\\(\text{NP} \cap \text{coNP}: \forall x \in \qty {0,1}^{\*}, \exists\\) short, efficiently checkable proof of BOTH \\(x\\) presence/absence in \\(L\\)

-   in P: [PERFECT-MATCHING]({{< relref "KBha_library_of_languages.md#perfect-matching" >}})
-   in P: [PRIMES]({{< relref "KBha_library_of_languages.md#primes" >}})
-   **we don't know if this is in \\(P\\)**: [FACTORING]({{< relref "KBha_library_of_languages.md#factoring" >}})
    ... if it was, much of cryptography will break
