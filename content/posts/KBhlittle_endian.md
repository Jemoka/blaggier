The [Little Endian]({{< relref "KBhlittle_endian.md" >}}) architecture is one which the numbers are laid out such that the smallest [byte]({{< relref "KBhbinary_number_system.md#byte" >}})s are placed earlier into memory. In a sense, all the numbers are stored in reverse if readnig from "left to "right"
