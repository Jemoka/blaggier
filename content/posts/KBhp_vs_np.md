[Polynomial Time]({{< relref "KBhcomputational_complexity_theory.md#polynomial-time" >}}) \\(P\\) vs [Non-Polynomial Time]({{< relref "KBhnon_deterministic_turing_machines.md#non-polynomial-time" >}}) \\(NP\\)

-   \\(P\\) are the problems that can be efficiently solved
-   \\(NP\\) are the problems where _proposed solutions_ can be efficiently verified

so! is \\(P=NP\\)?

If this is true, there are some consequences:

-   proving can be automated
-   cryptography would be able to be automated easily

anywhere there is a problem can be globally optimized. This is too good to be true, so probably \\(P \neq NP\\).
