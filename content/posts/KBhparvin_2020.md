## One-Liner {#one-liner}

An excercize scheme has had some measured effect on [theta/alpha ratio]({{< relref "KBhtheta_alpha_ratio.md" >}}) and Brain wave frequency on AD patients; prognosis of AD not controlled for.


## Novelty {#novelty}

-   Leveraged physical training scheme and measured EEG effects by quantifying [theta/alpha ratio]({{< relref "KBhtheta_alpha_ratio.md" >}})


## Notable Methods {#notable-methods}

-   Used [theta/alpha ratio]({{< relref "KBhtheta_alpha_ratio.md" >}}) as assay for improvement, and found the exercise scheme did so p&lt;0.05
-   Only tested patients with AD w/o a control for stage


## Key Figs {#key-figs}


### Figure 1 {#figure-1}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2022-06-25_11-13-14_screenshot.png" >}}

This figure tells us th N number of participants through the study


### Figure 2 {#figure-2}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2022-06-25_11-14-06_screenshot.png" >}}

This figure shows us that the excercize intervention has [statistically significant]({{< relref "KBhhypothesis_testing.md#significance-level" >}}) results to both Brain Oscillation frequency and Theta/Alpha ratio. The x-axis shows us the pre-and-post bars for TG (treatment) and CG (control); the y-axis quantifies the value measured in a box plot. The subplots are brain oscelation and [theta/alpha ratio]({{< relref "KBhtheta_alpha_ratio.md" >}}) respectively.
