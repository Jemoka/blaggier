## Past Work {#past-work}

-   **self play**: this is a \\(\text{coNP}\\) vs \\(\text{NP}\\) problem: whereas competitive self-play attempts to defend against all strategies, collaborative self-play only needs to find one useful strategy; this doesn't generalize well because humans are not a partner
-   **behavior cloning**:
-   [Population Based Training]({{< relref "KBhpopulation_based_training.md" >}}): computational super e


## Novelty {#novelty}

-   instead, learn a **generative model** from both simulated agents or human data
-   then, sample from this generative model
