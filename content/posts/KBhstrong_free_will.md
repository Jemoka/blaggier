## Reading Notes {#reading-notes}

[Strong Free Will]({{< relref "KBhstrong_free_will.md#reading-notes" >}}) vs. Weak Free Will --- "will" and "bells inequality" is a demonstration of indeterminism/randomness between particles --- but indeterminism and randomness a demonstration of will.


### That if humans have free will, it should be spawened from the indeterminism of elementary particles {#that-if-humans-have-free-will-it-should-be-spawened-from-the-indeterminism-of-elementary-particles}

It asserts, roughly, that if indeed we humans have free will, then elementary particles already have their own small share of this valuable commodity.


### SPIN Axiom {#spin-axiom}

SPIN Axiom: Measurements of the squared (components of) spin of a spin 1 particle in three orthogonal directions always give the answers 1, 0, 1 in some order.


### TWIN Axiom {#twin-axiom}

Paired particles will come up with same measurements if measured in the same way

The TWIN Axiom: For twinned spin 1 particles, suppose experimenter A performs a triple experiment of measuring the squared spin component of particle a in three orthogonal directions x, y, z, while experimenter B measures the twinned par- ticle b in one direction, w . Then if w happens to be in the same direction as one of x, y, z, experimenter B’s measurement will necessarily yield the same answer as the corresponding measurement by A.


### Free as something that cannot be an uncurried function of previous states {#free-as-something-that-cannot-be-an-uncurried-function-of-previous-states}

To say that A’s choice of x, y, z is free means more precisely that it is not determined by (i.e., is not a function of) what has happened at earlier times (in any inertial frame).


### MIN Axiom {#min-axiom}

Choice of direction of measurement of one twinned qubit does not influence the results of the current qubit (unless they happen to align.)

The MIN Axiom: Assume that the experiments performed by A and B are space-like separated. Then experimenter B can freely choose any one of the 33 particular directions w , and a’s response is independent of this choice. Similarly and inde- pendently, A can freely choose any one of the 40 triples x, y, z, and b’s response is independent of that choice.
