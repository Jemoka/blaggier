Two [vector]({{< relref "KBhvector.md" >}})s are considered [orthogonal]({{< relref "KBhorthogonal.md" >}}) if \\(\langle u,v \rangle = 0\\), that is, their [inner product]({{< relref "KBhinner_product.md" >}}) is \\(0\\).

See also [orthogonality test]({{< relref "KBhdot_product.md#orthogonality-test" >}}).


## orthogonality and \\(0\\) {#orthogonality-and-0}

-   \\(0\\) is orthogonal to every vector in \\(v\\) because \\(\langle 0,v \rangle=0\\) for every \\(v\\) because of the [properties of inner product]({{< relref "KBhinner_product.md#properties-of-inner-product" >}})
-   \\(0\\) is the only vector orthogonal to itself as, by [inner product]({{< relref "KBhinner_product.md" >}}) definiteness, \\(\langle v,v \rangle=0\\) implies \\(v=0\\).
