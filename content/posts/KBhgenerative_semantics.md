a hissyfight with the [transformational generative syntax]({{< relref "KBhtransformational_generative_syntax.md" >}}).

[generative semantics]({{< relref "KBhgenerative_semantics.md" >}}) states that ****structure**** is in support of ****meaning****, rather than the other way around that [transformational generative syntax]({{< relref "KBhtransformational_generative_syntax.md" >}}) suggests.

This means that you need to first come up with a meaning then imbew the best structure to support the expression of that meaning.

This (along with [distributed morphology]({{< relref "KBhdistributed_morphology.md" >}})) is the main opposition of the [Lexicalist Hypothesis]({{< relref "KBhlexicalization_hypothesis.md" >}}), and because [proof for the existence of semantic primes]({{< relref "KBhsemantic_primes.md#proof-for-the-existence-of-id-4e587814-bfd1-458e-ba5f-67882832107b-semantic-prime-s" >}}), also the main opposition of the existence of [semantic prime]({{< relref "KBhsemantic_primes.md" >}})s.
