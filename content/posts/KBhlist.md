A [list]({{< relref "KBhlist.md" >}}) is an ****ordered collection**** of \\(n\\) elements.


## requirements {#requirements}

-   as list length cannot be negative
-   list length cannot be  \\(\infty\\)
-   repetition matters
-   order matters


## additional info {#additional-info}

-   two lists are equal IFF they have
    -   same \\(n\\)
    -   same elements
    -   same order
-   they are different from [set]({{< relref "KBhset.md" >}})s because
    -   order matters
    -   (therefore, because in/out is no longer a binary) number of entries of the same object matters
    -   length is finite
