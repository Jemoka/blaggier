[darkpool]({{< relref "KBhdarkpool.md" >}})s are non-exchange, non-published exchange which doesn't have the same reporting obligations of a [stock market]({{< relref "KBhfinancial_markets_intro.md" >}}). The only thing they have to report is the actual filled transactions after 90 seconds.

[darkpool]({{< relref "KBhdarkpool.md" >}})s are used because the order book/bid-ask spread is not leaked, which means large transactions will not be able to influence the market as much.
