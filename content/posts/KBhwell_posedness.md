when eigenvalues of the problem setup is [well-posed]({{< relref "KBhwell_posedness.md" >}}), eigenvalues should have a negative real part (because they are convergent); otherwise, if the eigenvalues have a positive real part, they are divergent and hence [ill-posed]({{< relref "KBhwell_posedness.md" >}})
