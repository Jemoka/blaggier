AAAAA I want a good backpack.

requirements

---

1.  explicit laptop compartment (whether intentional or not; water bladder component that fits a laptop is fine)
2.  earbags (those fannypack things on the side of the bottom belt); needs to be large (i.e. enough to fit an iphone 5)
3.  raincover
4.  at least 3 compartments, ideally one with a pen holder and key ring, and the outermost being very accessible (think mesh bag)

basically I want an exact replica of the columbia silver ridge 30L from 2012 which they don't sell anymore; the new one breaks 4) slightly and is also $150 and I got mine for ilke $60-70 (it was like 300-350 rmb) max in 2012
