Gut bacteria are both adversly affected by 5-[Fluoropyrimidine]({{< relref "KBhfloraparimidine.md" >}}), and but they mtaybe able to inactivate synthesized [Fluoropyrimidine]({{< relref "KBhfloraparimidine.md" >}}).

[PreTA]({{< relref "KBhpreta.md" >}}) in [E. Coli]({{< relref "KBhe_coli.md" >}}) is an example of a bacterial that can do this. See [implications of PreTA deactivating Fluoropyrimidine]({{< relref "KBhimplications_of_preta_deactivating_fluoropyrimidine.md" >}}).
