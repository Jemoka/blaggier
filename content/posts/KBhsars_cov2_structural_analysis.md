[SARS-COV2]({{< relref "KBhsars_cov2.md" >}})

1.  traditional stain techniques to analyze the [epitopes]({{< relref "KBhepitophs.md" >}}) being targeted
2.  uses [cyro-EM]({{< relref "KBhcyro_em.md" >}}) structural analysis to figure structural points of neutralization
3.  predict correct antibodies binding to force certain structures to neutralize covid-19
4.  analyze mRNA-vax elicited antibodies to see similarity between those that are useful predicted in 3)

Study identified three [epitopes]({{< relref "KBhepitophs.md" >}}): C1520, C1791, C1717, which changes the structure/activity of all three variants of concern as identified using methods above, and are inpervious to the mutation to the main [supersite]({{< relref "KBhspersite.md" >}}).
