occasionally, you can't really get a specific solution.

\begin{equation}
\dv{y}{t} = e^{t}\cos y
\end{equation}

after doing the , you get:

\begin{equation}
\ln (\sec y + \tan y) - e^{t} = C
\end{equation}

you get sets of this function \\(F(t,y)\\) which shifts it up and down, by any constant C.

But at any given \\((t,y)\\), you get a slope \\(e^{t}\cos y\\).
