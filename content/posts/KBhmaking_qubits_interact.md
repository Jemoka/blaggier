Separated qubits don't really like to interact. Instead, then, we just make them bigger and control them at the same time. We can implement gates via a sequence of pulses. If you work with interacting [qubit]({{< relref "KBhqubits.md" >}})s a lot, you will end up with the [APR Paradox]({{< relref "KBhapr_paradox.md" >}}).

If you take two [qubit]({{< relref "KBhqubits.md" >}})s, and move them though two gates, you essentially will get [entangled]({{< relref "KBhentangled.md" >}}) results.

To make this works, you will need to take some probability. Know [correlation]({{< relref "KBhcorrelation.md" >}}), [expectation]({{< relref "KBhexpectation.md" >}}), etc.
