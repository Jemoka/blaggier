A [Differential Equation]({{< relref "KBhdiffeq_intro.md" >}}) is a function-valued  [algebreic equation]({{< relref "KBhalgebreic_equation.md" >}}) whose unknown is an entire [function]({{< relref "KBhfunction.md" >}}) \\(y(x)\\), where the equation involves a combination of derivatives $y(x), y'(x), ...$.
