[Young's Modulus]({{< relref "KBhyoung_s_modulus.md" >}}) is a mechanical property that measures the stiffness of a solid material.

It measures the ratio between mechanical [stress]({{< relref "KBhstress.md" >}}) \\(\sigma\\) and the relative resulting [strain]({{< relref "KBhstrain.md" >}}) \\(\epsilon\\).

And so, very simply:

\begin{equation}
E = \frac{\sigma }{\epsilon }
\end{equation}

Thinking about this, silly puddy deforms very easily given a little stress, so it would have _low_ [Young's Modulus]({{< relref "KBhyoung_s_modulus.md" >}}) (\\(\sigma \ll \epsilon\\)); and visa versa.
