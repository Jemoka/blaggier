A part of the [New Deal]({{< relref "KBhnew_deal.md" >}}) programs for unmarried men to go and build American infrastructure outdoors under reasonably harsh conditions. "Kind of like boy scouts for adults." It is structured like the military; Black men were segregated and not given leadership roles.

1933-1942.
