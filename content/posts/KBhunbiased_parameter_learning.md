If you are given the problem, you can learn the [parameter]({{< relref "KBhparameter.md" >}})s by just computing them. For instance, to estimate the [parameter]({{< relref "KBhparameter.md" >}})s of a [gaussian]({{< relref "KBhgaussian_distribution.md" >}}), we can compute the mean and variance and shove it in.
