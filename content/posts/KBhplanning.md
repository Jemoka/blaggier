A [decision making method]({{< relref "KBhdecision_making.md#id-9075c44f-4b26-4f5a-9236-bc7a5c10f4ee-decision-making-methods" >}}) using search on a model of the problem to be able tom make decisions.

1.  create a (usually deterministic, but for [CS238]({{< relref "KBhdecision_making_index.md" >}}) we care only about non-deterministic cases) model of the problem or a good approximation thereof
2.  use the model to plan for possible next actions to yield for a good solution
