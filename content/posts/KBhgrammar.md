A [grammar]({{< relref "KBhgrammar.md" >}}) is a set of logical rules that form a [language]({{< relref "KBhlanguage.md" >}}). (more precisely defined in [goals of a grammar](#goals-of-a-grammar--kbhgrammar-dot-md))


## goals of a [grammar]({{< relref "KBhgrammar.md" >}}) {#goals-of-a-grammar--kbhgrammar-dot-md}

-   explain natural languages in syntax + semantics
-   have described algebras which can be used to evolve the syntax
-   ...that describe the grammatical operations

The formalism here is that a rigorous [grammar]({{< relref "KBhgrammar.md" >}}) should have:

1.  [semantic accountability]({{< relref "KBhsemantic_accountability.md" >}})
2.  [generativity]({{< relref "KBhgenerativity.md" >}})
