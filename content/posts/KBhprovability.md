## Coping with NP Completeness {#coping-with-np-completeness}

It's possible to solve NP complete problems!

-   **average case/worst case complexity**: it's possible to solve [SAT]({{< relref "KBhnon_deterministic_turing_machines.md#boolean-formula-satisfiability" >}}) for a lot of problems which solves the average case problems ("Heuristics vs. Algorithms")
-   **special cases**: 2SAT, [subset sum]({{< relref "KBhnp_complete.md#subset-sum" >}}), etc. can be solved in very special cases
