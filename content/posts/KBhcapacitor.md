A capacitor changes, then resists being charged further. Their rules work opposite to [resistor]({{< relref "KBhresistors.md" >}})s.


## capacitor in series {#capacitor-in-series}

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{C\_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C\_1} + \frac{1}{C\_2} + \frac{1}{C\_3}
\end{equation}

and yet,


## capacitor in parallel {#capacitor-in-parallel}

\begin{equation}
C\_{eq} = C\_1 + C\_2 + C\_3
\end{equation}


## energy stored by a capacitor {#energy-stored-by-a-capacitor}

\begin{equation}
E = \frac{1}{2} CV^{2}
\end{equation}

where, \\(E\\) is the energy stored, \\(C\\) the capacitance, and \\(V\\) the [voltage]({{< relref "KBhvoltage.md" >}}) across the capacitor.

Which, subbing the formula below:

\begin{equation}
U = \frac{1}{2} \frac{Q^{2}}{C}
\end{equation}


## voltage across and max charge stored on a capacitor {#voltage-across-and-max-charge-stored-on-a-capacitor}

\begin{equation}
C = \frac{Q}{V}
\end{equation}

where, \\(Q\\) is the change and \\(V\\) the voltage

"the more change the capacitor can store given a voltage, the higher the capacitance."

\begin{equation}
Q = CV
\end{equation}
