## One-Liner {#one-liner}

Proposed cross-linguistic markers shared for AD patients between English and French; evaluated features found with standard ML.


## Novelty {#novelty}

Multi-lingual, cross-linguistic analysis.


## Notable Methods {#notable-methods}

-   Looked at common patters between the two languages
-   Linguistic results scored by [IU]({{< relref "KBhiu.md" >}})s on [CTP]({{< relref "KBhctp.md" >}}) task

This figure tells us the various approaches measured.


### Table 2 {#table-2}

Here's a list of semantic features extracted


### Table 3 {#table-3}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2022-06-24_23-32-18_screenshot.png" >}}

Here's a list of NLP features extracted. Bolded items represent P &lt;0.001 correlation for AD/NonAD difference between English and French.

Same thing but semantic features

same thing but acoustic features. As we can see, acoustic features didn't do much.
