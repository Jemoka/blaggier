[Rosetta]({{< relref "KBhrosetta.md" >}}) is a set of physical-based protein folding models.


## protein binding with [Rosetta]({{< relref "KBhrosetta.md" >}}) {#protein-binding-with-rosetta--kbhrosetta-dot-md}

-   check a protein surface
-   check how protein side-chains interact with the binding surface


## peptide binding with [Rosetta]({{< relref "KBhrosetta.md" >}}) {#peptide-binding-with-rosetta--kbhrosetta-dot-md}

The difficulty with this is that we don't know what the overall tertiary structure of a group of peptides are; unlike whole [protein binding](#protein-binding-with-rosetta--kbhrosetta-dot-md).


## sequence-specific DNA binding {#sequence-specific-dna-binding}

???


## more! {#more}

You take something like a trimer; you shove a peptide between each "point", and boom structal change to a quadromer
