[electric potential]({{< relref "KBhelectric_potential_energy.md" >}}) is analogous to [gravitational potential energy]({{< relref "KBhgravitational_potential_energy.md" >}}), but with electrostatics!

\begin{equation}
P\_{E} = qV
\end{equation}

where \\(q\\) is the change on the particle in question, and \\(V\\) is the [voltage]({{< relref "KBhvoltage.md" >}}), the difference in [electric potential]({{< relref "KBhelectric_potential_energy.md" >}}) between two places.

Yes, [voltage]({{< relref "KBhvoltage.md" >}}) is defined vis a vi [electric potential]({{< relref "KBhelectric_potential_energy.md" >}}): that is, it represents a _differential_ of [electric potential]({{< relref "KBhelectric_potential_energy.md" >}}).

Let \\(A, B, C\\) be positrons, and the lines are the [electric field]({{< relref "KBhelectric_field.md" >}}). Which one has the highest electric potential? \\(A\\), because it has the most distance to travel to until it can get all the way to the right.

#### parallel plates {#parallel-plates}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2023-03-18_13-40-07_screenshot.png" >}}

\begin{equation}
E = \frac{V}{d}
\end{equation}

where \\(d\\) is the distance between the plates, \\(E\\) the uniform [electric field]({{< relref "KBhelectric_field.md" >}}) between the plates.

The amount of [charge]({{< relref "KBhcharged.md" >}}) on each plate is described by:

\begin{equation}
Q = CV
\end{equation}

where, \\(C\\) is the [capacitance]({{< relref "KBhcapacitance.md" >}}) of each plate, and \\(V\\) the [voltage]({{< relref "KBhvoltage.md" >}}) across the plates.
