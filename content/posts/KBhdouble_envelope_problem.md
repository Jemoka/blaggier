One envelope has 10 times the money in the other money.

WLOG let \\(x\\) be the envelope in Cary's hand. The money in \\(y\\), then, \\(y = \frac{1}{2}\qty(\frac{1}{10}x)+\frac{1}{2}\qty (10x) = 0.05x+5x = 5.05x\\). Wat.

Basically; regardless if Cary took the envelope \\(x\\) or \\(y\\), the _other_ envelope is expected to have \\(5\times\\) more money. What.


## Why? {#why}

There's a bug in this:

\begin{equation}
y = \frac{1}{2}\qty(\frac{1}{10}x)+\frac{1}{2}\qty (10x)
\end{equation}

is not true! There is a human ****PRIOR BELIEF****!! Its very unlikely that mykel/chris put 10000 dollars into an envelope; so each individual amount in an envelope has an exogenous probability of it happening!
