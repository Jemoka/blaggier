\begin{equation}
V = IR
\end{equation}

where, \\(V\\) is the voltage across the resister, \\(I\\) the [current]({{< relref "KBhcurrent.md" >}}), and \\(R\\) the [resistance]({{< relref "KBhcurrent.md#resistance-of-a-wire" >}}).


## power (physics) {#power--physics}

the rate at which electrical energy dissipates into heat is called [power](#power--physics):

\begin{equation}
P = IV
\end{equation}

where, \\(P\\) is power, and \\(I\\) the [current]({{< relref "KBhcurrent.md" >}}), and \\(V\\) the [voltage]({{< relref "KBhvoltage.md" >}}).

Alternate formulation of power:

\begin{equation}
P = I V = \frac{V^{2}}{R} = I^{2} R = \dv{E}{t}
\end{equation}
