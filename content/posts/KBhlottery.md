A [lottery]({{< relref "KBhlottery.md" >}}) is a choice problem, where each outcome has a certain [probability]({{< relref "KBhprobability.md" >}}):

\begin{equation}
[S\_1:p\_1, \dots, S\_{n}:p\_{n}]
\end{equation}

where, \\(S\_{j}\\) has \\(p\_{j}\\) chance of occurring.


## utility of a lottery {#utility-of-a-lottery}

For a lottery, the [utility]({{< relref "KBhutility_theory.md" >}}) thereof is the probability of a state happening times the [utility]({{< relref "KBhutility_theory.md" >}}) of the state:

that is,

\begin{equation}
U([S\_1:p\_1, \dots, S\_{n}:p\_{n}]) = \sum\_{i=1}^{N} p\_{i}U(S\_{i})}
\end{equation}
