Slightly nontraditional Ted class, which is that it is in complete modular architecture: no large group lectures, work is done in 2-3 week sprints.

First two days, we will be doing intro together. There are 12 modules, and you do 6. There will be core modules and branches.

There are 3 symposiums which the groups share out. This class is very hard; we are using a graduate school textbook. We will be sidestepping some depth: main idea is to show the big area.
