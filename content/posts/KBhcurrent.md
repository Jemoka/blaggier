[current]({{< relref "KBhcurrent.md" >}}) is defined as the flow of positive [charge]({{< relref "KBhcharged.md" >}}). Specifically:

\begin{equation}
I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}


## resistance of a wire {#resistance-of-a-wire}

(if ever you come across needing to calculate the resistance of the wire from scratch)

\begin{equation}
R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
\end{equation}

where, \\(\rho\\) is the material resistivity, \\(L\\) the length, and \\(A\\) the cross-sectional area.

you rarely need to do this!
