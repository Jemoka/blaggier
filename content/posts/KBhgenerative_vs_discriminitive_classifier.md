## Generative Classifier {#generative-classifier}

A [Generative Classifier](#generative-classifier) builds a good model of a class, and use that to assign how "class-y" is that image.

For instance, to categorize cats vs. dogs, we build a cat model and dog model. To classify, then, we see if a particular image is more "cat-y" or "dog-y".


## Discriminative Classifier {#discriminative-classifier}

A [Discriminative Classifier](#discriminative-classifier) observes the differences between two classes, instead of trying to model each one.
