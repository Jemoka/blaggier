## quadratic utility {#quadratic-utility}

\begin{equation}
U(x) = \lambda x - x^{2}
\end{equation}

where, \\(\lambda>0\\) controls [risk aversion]({{< relref "KBhexpected_utility_of_wealth.md" >}}): as risk increases, utility increases concavely, then eventually utility falls


## exponential utility {#exponential-utility}

\begin{equation}
U(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}
\end{equation}

where \\(\lambda >0\\) controls [risk aversion]({{< relref "KBhexpected_utility_of_wealth.md" >}}). This is usually not plausible as utility because people's utility doesn't grow exponentially ever


## power utility {#power-utility}
