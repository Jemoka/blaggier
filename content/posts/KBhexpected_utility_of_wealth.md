Wealth is a much more complex [utility]({{< relref "KBhutility_theory.md" >}}) than others because given the different levels of wealth you have the marginal benefit of having that wealth decreases.

That is, let \\(A\\) be the fact that you are given $50, and let \\(B\\) be there being \\(0.5\\) chance of winning $100.

-   [risk neutral]({{< relref "KBhexpected_utility_of_wealth.md" >}}): the [utility]({{< relref "KBhutility_theory.md" >}}) is linear---therefore \\(A \sim B\\)
-   [risk seeking]({{< relref "KBhexpected_utility_of_wealth.md" >}}): [utility]({{< relref "KBhutility_theory.md" >}}) is convex (derivative increases as reward increases), so \\(A \prec B\\)
-   [risk averse]({{< relref "KBhexpected_utility_of_wealth.md" >}}): [utility]({{< relref "KBhutility_theory.md" >}}) is concave (derivate decreases as reward decreases), so \\(A \succ B\\)
