[Computational Biology]({{< relref "KBhcomputational_biology_index.md" >}}) is a the study of biology using computation.

Rather that starting from the properties, start with the end states or what properties it has; instead, we define the initial values based on the edges.

Constructor theory: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_theory>?

-   the relationship between temperature and occurance of a uniform gas is actually right-skewed; the mean temperature in a uniform closed system will be higher than the median temperature
-   molecules are not static: at best, molecules are static when frozen in place; yet, generally it is not in their nature to stay solidly in place; they just shuffle around but maintain the molecular sturucture

If the energy level is higher, it will ignore various troughs
