an atom is said to be [charged]({{< relref "KBhcharged.md" >}}) when there is an imbalance between its number of [proton]({{< relref "KBhprotons.md" >}})s and [electron]({{< relref "KBhelectron.md" >}})s.


## additional information {#additional-information}


### units of charge {#units-of-charge}

[charge]({{< relref "KBhcharged.md" >}}) is measured in SI unit \\(C\\), coulomb. However, we are often dealing with \\(e\\), the charge of an [electron]({{< relref "KBhelectron.md" >}}) (as ultimate that's the principle way by which charge moves around). \\(e \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-19} C\\).


### net charge can be neither created nor destroyed {#net-charge-can-be-neither-created-nor-destroyed}

Unsurprisingly, though you can move [electron]({{< relref "KBhelectron.md" >}})s around, they will be conserved across a system.
