## Key Sequence {#key-sequence}


## Notation {#notation}


## New Concepts {#new-concepts}

-   tying into [Separated Equations]({{< relref "KBhfirst_order_odes.md#separated-equations" >}}): \\(y' = f(t,y)\\) which are the most nicest. Recall that there was two special cases: [seperable]({{< relref "KBhseperable_diffequ.md" >}}) and [autonomous ODEs]({{< relref "KBhautonomous_odes.md" >}}).
    -   if we can write in terms of elementary function, good times
    -   if we can't do it in terms of elementary functions, we can use qualitative analysis t(slope field, etc.)
-   recall again [Newton's Law of Cooling]({{< relref "KBhnewton_s_law_of_cooling.md" >}})
-   [phase line]({{< relref "KBhphase_line.md" >}}) and [stability (ODEs)]({{< relref "KBhstability.md" >}})


## Important Results / Claims {#important-results-claims}

-   [autonomous]({{< relref "KBhautonomous_odes.md" >}}) [First Order ODEs]({{< relref "KBhfirst_order_odes.md" >}})' solutions do not cross; as in, if there are two solutinos \\(y\_1\\) and \\(y\_2\\), their curves never intersect.
-   [one and exactly one solution exist for every point of an IVP]({{< relref "KBhinitial_value_problems.md#one-and-exactly-one-solution-exist-for-every-point-of-an-ivp" >}})
-   [autonomous ODEs level off at stationary curves]({{< relref "KBhautonomous_odes.md#autonomous-odes-level-off-at-stationary-curves" >}})
