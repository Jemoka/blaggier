the [transformational generative syntax]({{< relref "KBhtransformational_generative_syntax.md" >}}) is a linguistical precept proposed by [Noam Chomsky]({{< relref "KBhchomsky.md" >}}) which has the interesting conclusion that ****meaning**** is supported by ****structure****, rather than the other way around as [generative semantics]({{< relref "KBhgenerative_semantics.md" >}}) suggests.

This means that you can first come up with generic, independent structure to a sentence, then fill in the sentence with meaning.

For instance, "colorless green ideas sleep furiously" is a sentence [Noam Chomsky]({{< relref "KBhchomsky.md" >}}) proposes to have perfect structure but failes to be filled with meaning, supporting the [transformational generative syntax]({{< relref "KBhtransformational_generative_syntax.md" >}}) theory.

This supports the [Lexicalist Hypothesis]({{< relref "KBhlexicalization_hypothesis.md" >}}), which is the theory that lexicalization transformations are independent of structural transformations. This would therefore support the [proof for the existence of semantic primes]({{< relref "KBhsemantic_primes.md#proof-for-the-existence-of-id-4e587814-bfd1-458e-ba5f-67882832107b-semantic-prime-s" >}}).
