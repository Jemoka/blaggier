goal: [Drug Resistance]({{< relref "KBhdrug_resistance.md" >}}) could be more hampered by developing drugs that actually fit in the sub-strait envelope (i.e. if a virus develops a change to the drugged area, it should also stop working)

takeaway: to design inhibitors, it sticking out ("protrusion") of the [substrate envelope]({{< relref "KBhsubtrait_envelope.md" >}}) causes easy areas of mutation that will confer [Drug Resistance]({{< relref "KBhdrug_resistance.md" >}}), therefore, design drugs that try to stay within [substrate envelope]({{< relref "KBhsubtrait_envelope.md" >}}) to ensure a higher degree of imperviousness to mutation (i.e. if the envelope changes well the virus is going to not do its job either)


## Messing with HIV {#messing-with-hiv}

-   mutations outside the active site (in primary backbone structure) actually caused a large increase in resistance (4 points outside of backbone structure)
-   use linreg and other ML methods to take the _type_ of mutation change (hydrogen? binding? etc.) and to find features most important to confer resistance


## Messing with COVID MPro {#messing-with-covid-mpro}

-   COVID has many mutations on the
-   aligned sequences to figure conserved interactions
-   paxlovid nemdesirvir binds strongly to E166, which---though conserved---still could be resistant to resistance
