We will leverage [atoms as qubits]({{< relref "KBhatoms_as_qubits.md" >}}). So, how do we isolate a [qubit]({{< relref "KBhqubits.md" >}}) from an atom? We will leverage electrons.

We will select the lowest energy state as the base state; as there maybe multiple ground states, we will choose \\(|u\big>\\) and \\(|d\big>\\) from two of the states.
