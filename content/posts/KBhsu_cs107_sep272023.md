## Core Themes of CS107 {#core-themes-of-cs107}

**how and why** of 107:

-   **how** is program data represented in the hardware
-   **how** does the heap work and **how** is it implemented
-   **how** does a computer know how run code
-   **how** does an executable map onto computer systems
-   **why** is my program doing one thing when I expect it to do something else

"why is this broken system behaving the way it does?"


## Core Goals of CS107 {#core-goals-of-cs107}


### fluency {#fluency}

-   pointers and memory, and how to make use of them
-   an executable's address space + runtime behavior


### competency {#competency}

-   the translation of C to and from assembly
-   implement programs with limits of computer arithmetic
-   identify bottlenecks and improve runtime performance
-   navigate Unix
-   ethical frameworks to design and implement software


### exposure {#exposure}

computer architecture


## Content of CS107 {#content-of-cs107}

-   bits and bytes
-   chars and c strings
-   pointers stacks and heaps
-   generics: use them
-   assembly: reverse an engineering of binary
-   heap allocators: implement malloc and free
