For directed acyclic graphs, a [topological sort]({{< relref "KBhtopological_sort.md" >}}) of a directed graph is such that if there's an edge \\(A \to B\\), then \\(A\\) comes before \\(B\\) in the sort.

Under direct acyclic graphs, a [topological sort]({{< relref "KBhtopological_sort.md" >}}) always exist.
