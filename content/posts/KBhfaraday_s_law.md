We have that:

The change in volts in a relationship to the magnetic flux.

\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = - \dv{\Phi\_{b}}{t}
\end{equation}

where, \\(\Phi\_{b}\\) is the magnetic flux, namely how much magnetic field is through a surface:

\begin{equation}
\Phi\_{b} = \int \vec{B} \cdot \dd{\vec{A}}
\end{equation}

usually, this is just \\(BA\\).

Note! This tells us that the EMF (electric field per length) is just negative the change of magnetic flux.
