the fast you are willing to [prototype]({{< relref "KBhprototyping.md" >}}), the more willing you are to fail, the faster you will get to a successful partial solution you can refine and repeat.


## how to prototype faster? {#how-to-prototype-faster}

In order of decreasing slowness----

-   build out the whole product...
-   building the minimum viable product...
-   skeleton prototyping (Figma)...
-   Pen and paper...
-   Talking about it

The trade-off: each level gives increased _fidelity_: its closer to what will actually ship, so you can get better+detailed feedback.
