1.  Orbits of planetary bodies are ellipses with the sun at one of the two foci
2.  Drawing a line from the sun to the orbiting body, they would sweep out equal areas
3.  Planets that are closer to the sun have much shorter periods than that
    -   Squares of the periods of the planets is equal to the cubes of the distance from the planet to the sun
