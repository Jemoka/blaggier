Take two actors, Alice \\(A\\) and Bob \\(B\\). They each have a space \\(S\_A\\) and \\(S\_B\\). What if, for instance, we want to create a [composite system]({{< relref "KBhcomposite_system.md" >}}) out of Alice and Bob?

We will define elements in the Alice space as being defined by bases \\(H\\) and \\(T\\), where each element \\(a \in S\_a\\) is defined as:

\begin{equation}
   \alpha\_H | H \big\\} + \alpha\_T | T \big\\}
\end{equation}

Why the weird kets? We will use different kets to be aware of where bases came from; as in, elements in Alicespace is not elements in Bobspace.

Let's take Bobspace to be a higher dimension, as in, using normal ket vectors:

\begin{align}
|1\big> \\\\
|2\big> \\\\
|3\big> \\\\
\cdots \\\\
|6\big>
\end{align}
