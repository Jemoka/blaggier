I have ****no idea**** why a thermal camera is needed


## Key Figs {#key-figs}

Here are the features they extracted

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2022-06-24_21-07-27_screenshot.png" >}}

Developed the features collected via a method similar to action research, did two passes and refined/added information after preliminary analysis. Figure above also include info about whether or not the measurement was task specific.

and there are the biomarkers and medical data they collected
