For a charge to do something in a magnetic field, it has to have velocity; nothing happens without **movement**.

So:

\begin{equation}
\vec{F}\_{M} = q \vec{v} \times \vec{B}
\end{equation}

To calculate: magnitude: \\(qvB \sin \theta\\) + right hand rule.


## Radius {#radius}

You maybe asked to find the radius of the path the particle takes, so:

\begin{equation}
\frac{v^{2}}{r} = a
\end{equation}

So, the net force here is:

\begin{equation}
qvB = Ma
\end{equation}

So plug in and solve


## Current along a wire {#current-along-a-wire}

\begin{equation}
\vec{F} = \int I \dd{l} \times \vec{B}
\end{equation}

The sum of the current across the wire is the same as \\(q \vec{v}\\).

This equals \\(IlB \sin \theta\\) in magnitude for constant current.

"FILB - sintheta"


## Induced magnetic field {#induced-magnetic-field}

For the induced magnetic field of a current, use the curvey (curl) right hand rule.

The actual **magnitude** induced by the wire is ampere's law:

\begin{equation}
\oint \vec{B} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = \mu I
\end{equation}

where, \\(u\_0\\) is vacuum permeability (\\(4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \frac{T \cdot m}{A}\\)).


## Magnetic Field of a Solenoid {#magnetic-field-of-a-solenoid}

\begin{equation}
Bs = \mu\_{0} n I
\end{equation}

where, \\(n = \frac{N}{L}\\), the number of turns of the solenoid per length.


## Magnetic Field of a Loop {#magnetic-field-of-a-loop}

\begin{equation}
B 2\pi r = \mu\_{0} I
\end{equation}

where, the surface integral of length of a loop is just the circumference


## WIRES ARE OPPOSITE {#wires-are-opposite}

Current's induced magnetic fields in the **same direction attracts**, and in **opposite directinos repel**
