\begin{equation}
y' = f(y)
\end{equation}

for autonomous ODEs, we can plot a [phase line]({{< relref "KBhphase_line.md" >}})

because autonomouse ODEs, we can plot such a line whereby we can analyze the direction of a solution function's travel

a particle's one-way motion must converge to a stationary value, or \\(\pm \infty\\), as \\(t\\) increases
