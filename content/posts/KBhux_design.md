The [User Experience]({{< relref "KBhux_design.md" >}}) design sprung out of WWII---in Aerospace engineering.


## The Design Process {#the-design-process}

The "Double Diamond" Process


### First Round of Going Broad {#first-round-of-going-broad}

-   Explore the problem space (what are you users trying to do? why? why is it hard?)
-   Decide what to fix (what is the most high impact problem?)


### Second Round of Going Broad {#second-round-of-going-broad}

-   Test potential solutions (does this fix the problem?)
-   Refine final solution (do all users understand this? can they use them?)


## Usability Heuristics {#usability-heuristics}

[Usability Heuristics](#usability-heuristics) is a set of principles used in [User Experience]({{< relref "KBhux_design.md" >}}) design to identify problems and potential solutions.


### Visibility of System Status {#visibility-of-system-status}

Keep the users informed about what's actively going on, through appropriate visual feedback placed at an appropriate amount of time.


### Match Between System and the Real World {#match-between-system-and-the-real-world}

Use language that's familiar to the user, using words, phrases, concepts familiar to the users rather than internal jargon.


### Balance User Control and Freedom {#balance-user-control-and-freedom}

User often perform actions by mistake; mark "emergency exits" to leave unwanted pathways/actions without causing side effects.


### Consistency and Standards {#consistency-and-standards}

Having consistency between different versions/family of products: putting buttons that do the same thing to the same place across the app, at the same region.


### Error Prevention {#error-prevention}

Eliminate error-prone conditions (prevent the users from doing it), or present users with a confirmation before they commit to an erroneous action


### Recognition vs. Recall {#recognition-vs-dot-recall}

Users should't need to remember when they are going through an UI; instead they should be able to recognize the intended behavior from the UI


### Flexibility and Efficiency of User {#flexibility-and-efficiency-of-user}

Catering functionality to both novice and advanced users. Make advanced actions hidden to novice users, but easily accessible for advanced users.


### Minimalism {#minimalism}

Keep the UI focused on essential actions and information---maintaining an aesthetic and minimalist design


### Help Users Recognize, Diagnoses, and Recover from Errors {#help-users-recognize-diagnoses-and-recover-from-errors}

Errors should...

1.  give context for what the problem is
2.  instruct the user for possible next actions


### Help {#help}

It maybe necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks; the documentation should be clear
