A [PKM]({{< relref "KBhpkm.md" >}}) is a tool (like this one!) to help manage your nodes and knowledge.

-   storing AND processing; just storing is just PIM not PKM
-   PKM = PIM (personal info management) + GTD + knowledge management
-   goal: narrowing "flood" and focus on useful areas
-   move from passive =&gt; active consumption
-   create, not just regurgitate


## PKM and Context {#pkm-and-context}

-   store info based on context


## Strategy {#strategy}

-   What are you trying to organize
-   what are the inputs?
    -   email? lectures?:
        -   "reference" type emails
        -   lecture notes
        -   tasks?
-   what are you trying to make?
    -   test? essays?
        -   a time blocking schedule
        -   studying for tests (i.e. for linear, etc.)
-   what does your process look like?
    -   mishmash of topic based notes and content based notes
-   what parts of it would you like to improve?
    -   article capture workflow: how to process random readings topic wise?
    -   knowledge capture: how to come across new content and capture them somewhere?
    -   todo/notes integration: task management and note taking currently lives separately, how to unify them?

## progressive summarization {#progressive-summarization}

[progressive summarization](#progressive-summarization) is a technique in note taking that [Tiago Forte]({{< relref "KBhtiago_forte.md" >}}) developed to summarize text:

-   layer 0: reading
-   layer 1: copy/pasted parts from the reading
-   layer 2: bold relevant parts
-   layer 3: highlight bold parts to get crux of ideas
-   layer 4: mini summary
-   layer 5: remix (add links, etc.)


## capture {#capture}

-   read
-   rewrite and _summarize_
-   _engage_ by adding **questions**, **thoughts**, **opinions**, etc.
-   _connect old and new ideas_
-   think about the _context_ of usage, not the topic


## how to think better {#how-to-think-better}

-   reduce cognitive overload
-   "offload info"---put it on paper
-   test yourself often: listening and understanding are not the same
-   keep things simple: one task at a time
-   keep an open mind + "collective" new perspectives and mental models


## new cycle {#new-cycle}

-   capture
-   curate
-   cultivate
-   connect
-   create
