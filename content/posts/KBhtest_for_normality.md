Given what you claim as a [normal distribution]({{< relref "KBhnormal_distribution.md" >}}), we can test for its normality. Any distribution you claim as normal has to follow that:

\begin{equation}
   np \geq 10 & n(1-p) \geq 10
\end{equation}

that number of successes and failures need both be greater than or equal to ten.
