The [capacitance]({{< relref "KBhcapacitance.md" >}}) is the amount of change something can hold; this scales based on how much [electric potential]({{< relref "KBhelectric_potential_energy.md" >}}) is being applied.


## Parallel plates {#parallel-plates}

\begin{equation}
C = \frac{\epsilon\_{0} A}{d}
\end{equation}

where, \\(e\_0\\) is the [permittivity of free space]({{< relref "KBhpermittivity_of_free_space.md" >}}), \\(A\\) the area of the plates, and \\(d\\) their distance.
