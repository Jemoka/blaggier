Bits is a universal currency to transmit information. As long as we can encode


## Source-Channel Separation Theorem {#source-channel-separation-theorem}

"Are we loosing information by using Bits? No."

Statement:

If a source can be transmitted over a channel at a certain resolution, then it can be transmitted using a binary interface between the source and channel at the same resolution.

Meaning:

If a communication channel has a certain fidelity for arbitrary data, encoding the data by bits will not change the fidelity of the channel.
