\begin{align}
0v &= (0+0)v \\\\
&= 0v+0v
\end{align}

Given [scalar multiplication]({{< relref "KBhscalar_multiplication.md" >}}) is [closed]({{< relref "KBhclosed.md" >}}), \\(0v \in V\\), which means \\(\exists -0v:0v+(-0v)=0\\). Applying that to both sides:

\begin{equation}
0 = 0v\ \blacksquare
\end{equation}

The opposite proof of \\(\lambda 0=0\\) but vectors work the same exact way.
