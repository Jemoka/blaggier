1.  tag EEG by data type (what mental stage does it come from?)
2.  per region, per data type, we take a band-power series
3.  calculate statistics per series
4.  shove the results into something interpretable


## Conclusion {#conclusion}

N1 results performs the best across brain regions; where the data came from didn't change performance by much.
