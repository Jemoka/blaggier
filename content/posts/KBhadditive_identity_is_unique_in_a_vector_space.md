Assume for the sake of contradiction \\(\exists\ 0, 0'\\) both being additive identities in vector space \\(V\\).

Therefore:

\begin{equation}
0+0' = 0' +0
\end{equation}

[commutativity]({{< relref "KBhcommutivity.md" >}}).

Therefore:

\begin{equation}
0+0' = 0 = 0'+0 = 0'
\end{equation}

defn. of identity.

Hence: \\(0=0'\\), \\(\blacksquare\\).
