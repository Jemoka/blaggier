## Disk based architecture {#disk-based-architecture}

-   the DBMS primarily stores stuff on non-violatle disk
-   meaning: the DBMS' job is to move stuff between violatle and non-volatle storage


### Challenges {#challenges}

-   how do you makue sure memory-writtten info is commited to disk?


### Hierarchy model {#hierarchy-model}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2024-09-04_14-09-26_screenshot.png" >}}

there's a tradeoff because as your system because faster, you have less of it and (in case its volatle) it stays around less long


### Access Order {#access-order}

Key challenge: **random-access on non-volatile storage is almost always slower than sequential access**

Good DBMS algorithms tries to reduce writes to random pages so stuff is in continuous blocks.


### Subchapters {#subchapters}

-   [DBMS Storage Format]({{< relref "KBhdbms_storage_layer.md" >}})
-   [DBMS Storage Management]({{< relref "KBhdbms_storage_management.md" >}})


## Overall DBMS Goals {#overall-dbms-goals}

-   We should manage databases that's larger than memory available
-   We should limit reading/writing to disk
-   We should minimize random accesses


## Lifetime of a request {#lifetime-of-a-request}

1.  execution engine asks for a page, say page 2
2.  memory asks its directory for where page 2 is
3.  memory found it missing, so ask disk for page 2
4.  disk loads page 2 into memory page 2
5.  memory gives execution engine a pointer to memory
