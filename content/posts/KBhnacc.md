[NACC]({{< relref "KBhnacc.md" >}}) is a large, longitudinal dataset for neurodegentitive disease as a project in collaboration with [Dr. Alyssa Weakley]({{< relref "KBhdr_alyssa_weakley.md" >}}) at [UC Davis]({{< relref "KBhuc_davis.md" >}}).

[Dr. Alyssa Weakley]({{< relref "KBhdr_alyssa_weakley.md" >}}) is interested in

-   [Early Cognitive Change]({{< relref "KBhearly_cognitive_change.md" >}})
-   Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)

"How early can we detect, using [NACC]({{< relref "KBhnacc.md" >}}), change?"


## dataset construction {#dataset-construction}

-   Participants are given a battery of mental capacity tests, these values are tracked over time
-   There are also family member questionnaire
-   Neuroimaging and biomarker data

Other things tracked in the data---

-   Amyloid levels of spinal fluid
-   Detecting even earlier


## focus {#focus}

-   good to focus on specifically _alzheimer's type dementia_
-   (so, ignore things on lewy body disease)
-   Using clinical diagnosis as the dependent variable, but good to see the autopsy results

Items 3 and 7 are independent codes; if alzhimer's is measured, MCI is not measured. visa versa.
