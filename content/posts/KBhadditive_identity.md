The [additive identity]({{< relref "KBhadditive_identity.md" >}}) allows another [number]({{< relref "KBhnumber.md" >}}) to retain its identity after [adding]({{< relref "KBhadding.md" >}}). That is: there exists an element \\(0\\) such that \\(v+0=v\\) for whatever structure \\(v\\) and addition \\(+\\) you are working with.
