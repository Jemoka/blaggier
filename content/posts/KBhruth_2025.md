## One-Liner {#one-liner}

Governments' security guidance lack overall consensus in both formatting as well as actual practice; we find this out using treeeeees.


## Novelty {#novelty}

-   new tree similarity mechanism similar to edit distance
-   first hand-labeled ontological dataset for security guidance


## Notable Methods {#notable-methods}

1.  download security guidance
2.  label guidance into multi-level controls
3.  tree distance metric for similarity
