revising:

-   character as subjects, actions as verbs
-   old before new (connect sentences' subjects from tail to head)
-   short before long: (say the short phrase before the long phrase, move the verb up front if you can)
-   topic then stress (the last position is being stressed—the thing that's most important to communicate is the end of an utterance)
-   The above principles apply to all units—as in, each sentences paragraphs, and arguments should all follow a similar principles
