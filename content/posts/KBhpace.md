[PACE]({{< relref "KBhpace.md" >}}) is a form of [Directed Evolution]({{< relref "KBhdirected_evolution.md" >}}): which use a bacteriophage with a bit of its gene removed; then, engineer a virus to infect the bacteria, which will only successfully complete infection if the missing area is provided.

The mutation of this virus, then, essentially RNG-s mutations of new functions and will only produce successful new generations of bacteriologist when it works.


## PACE is hard {#pace-is-hard}

The only way to check that [PACE]({{< relref "KBhpace.md" >}}) worked in the direction you want is by sampling the bacteria and hope that they are evolving in the correct direction
