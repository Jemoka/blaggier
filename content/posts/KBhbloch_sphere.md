The [bloch sphere]({{< relref "KBhbloch_sphere.md" >}}) is a sphere encoding all possible probabilities of a [qubit]({{< relref "KBhqubits.md" >}}) shared between two axis, \\(|u\big>\\) and \\(|d\big>\\).

You will notice that its a unit sphere, in which any magnitude has size \\(1\\). Hence, probabilities would result as projected onto each of the directions.
