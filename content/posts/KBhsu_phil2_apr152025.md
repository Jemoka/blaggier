## Theories of Morality {#theories-of-morality}

"Desires/Motives/Reasons" -&gt; "Reflection/Reasoning" -&gt; "Choices" -&gt; "Actions" -&gt; "Outcomes/Consequences"


## Utilitarianism {#utilitarianism}

"the greatest happiness for the greatest number"

The rightness or wrongness of an action depends only on the actual net total sum of pain and pleasure brought about by this particular action for all sentient creatures, compared to the alternatives considered from the "point of view of the universe."


### utility monster objection {#utility-monster-objection}

Consider someone who is not stated


### motivation {#motivation}

-   Q: "What makes a social norm/law/action good?"
-   A: "If it doesn't do any good, it isn't any good."

Are there any "wrong actions?" That is, wrong just because of the actions themselves? Utilitarians say no.

Utilitarianism is a theory of right/wrong, which are properties of **actions**. This is distinct between things that are valuable/dis-valuable good/bad.


#### consiquentialism {#consiquentialism}

This is distinct from _consequentialism_: this explains rightness and wrongness in terms of the action's goodness / badness (whether the action "[promote](#promote)s" goodness/badness.)


### promote {#promote}

In philosophy, to [promote](#promote) something involves...

1.  causing it to happens
2.  fulfill preconditions
3.  prevents preventers
4.  constituting it
