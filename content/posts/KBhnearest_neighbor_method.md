A very simple [machine learning]({{< relref "KBhmachine_learning.md" >}}) method.

For some input \\(\qty (\hat{x}, \hat{y})\\), find the closest training data point \\(\qty (x\_{i}, y\_{i})\\) and return its associated \\(z\_{i}\\), with error \\(\mid z\_{i} - \hat{z}\mid\\). Consider a [Voronoi Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram)!

This surface is _piecewise constant_.
