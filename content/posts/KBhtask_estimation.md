Step 0: know what you are building.


## breaking tasks {#breaking-tasks}

The process of [breaking tasks](#breaking-tasks) down.

-   We need to research tasks to see how complex they are + how to break them down
-   Research takes time! It should be its own task
-   Over the process of research, the task becomes much simpler


## estimating tasks {#estimating-tasks}

Requirement: tasks should _always_ be estimated by the person doing the work.

-   [Task Estimation]({{< relref "KBhtask_estimation.md" >}}) should be done _each time!_ tasks shift
-   Estimate only in powers of 2: 30 minutes, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, etc.
-   If you never done something before, **double** the time than you estimate
-   If you are teaching someone to do something, **quadruple** the time than you estimate
-   Add buffer time (\*1.5), especially if you think yourself as a procrastinator
    -   Focus is draining! You need breaks. Take breaks.
    -   Things will go wrong! Plan for it.


## time iterating {#time-iterating}

-   If anything is longer than 8 hours, that's a good sign you need to break it down!
-   Likely that you have to break things down


## MVP {#mvp}

You probably don't have time to build your feature list

-   MVP: minimum viable product
-   We need the basic set of features; you probably have more features than you have time to build
-   Prioritize what you build based on...
    -   Dependencies: is this required for other stuff to work
    -   Viability: can the product exist without this?
    -   Time: how long does it take?

Be ruthless about what you cut; talk to your user.
