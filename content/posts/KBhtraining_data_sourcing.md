Finding training data for AI is hard. So instead:


## Intentional training data {#intentional-training-data}

-   curated for training data
-   Spent time thinking about bias, control, etc.


## Training set of convenience {#training-set-of-convenience}

-   Dataset that just comes about
-   Problematic:

Accidentally introduce bias into the data: Googling images of CEOs, which is convenient, results in all white males for a bit.
