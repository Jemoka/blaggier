## Prichard's Dilemma {#prichard-s-dilemma}

"Why do the right thing?"

-   give some extra-moral reason (bad, because you maybe are acting in self-interest)
-   give some moral reason ("I do the right thing because its right", tautology)


## Kantian Contractualism {#kantian-contractualism}

"rules that would be agreed to by people trying to share a world as equals"


## scanlon {#scanlon}

what no one commuted to sharing a world could reasonably reject as a basis of informed, unforced general agreement

1.  substantive (sharing a world, presupposed content to what is a value) rather than formal
2.  restricted (moral)
3.  proceduralist (its about following a procedure, irrespective of what the output is)
