## Tips {#tips}

-   A well-run startup should have **18 month of cash planned**, and have a **runway of 6 months** to ensure you can always get acq-hired and "bail out"


## Myths of Startups {#myths-of-startups}

-   "Joining Big Tech" vs. "Starting a Startup" are **not** binary options
-   In between these poles: joining an existing startup


### Myth: "90% of startups of fail" {#myth-90-of-startups-of-fail}

True statement: 90% of **SMALL BUSINESSES** fail. Venture backed tech startups are **very different world**: only 1% of small businesses are venture backed.

Roughly: 1/3 of VC backed startups "fail"

-   1/3 fail
-   1/2 return the money (nothing happens)
-   1/6 exits + drive returns


### Myth (kinda): "you are under paid" {#myth--kinda--you-are-under-paid}

If you JOIN a startup, the small amount of compensation corresponds to betting on yourself in a similar way.

If you are negotiating your compensation, you should try to get MORE EQUITY and less cash.


## Anatomy of a Startup "Fail" {#anatomy-of-a-startup-fail}

-   Investors loose money
-   Employees get a minor payoff
