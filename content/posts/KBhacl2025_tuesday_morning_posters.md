## ACL2025 Katz: segment based attention masking {#acl2025-katz-segment-based-attention-masking}

Key insight: allow by directional attention


## ACL2025 Monodorf: exploring modular sturctures transformer based language models {#acl2025-monodorf-exploring-modular-sturctures-transformer-based-language-models}

Key insight: learn circuit compositions by learning a binary mask for both faithfulness and scarcity


## ACL2025 Li: some more samples of next token prediction {#acl2025-li-some-more-samples-of-next-token-prediction}

Key insight: when there's a high difference between generation probability and ground truth, those samples when intervene will cause a more dramatic effect


## ACL2025 Kim: counterfactual consistency prompting {#acl2025-kim-counterfactual-consistency-prompting}

Key insight: prompt with counter factual for temporal order to be able to be more consistent temporally


## ACL2025 Peng: guiding retrieval augmented reasoning through process reward tree search {#acl2025-peng-guiding-retrieval-augmented-reasoning-through-process-reward-tree-search}

Key insight: breakdown original query into sub parts and answers, using Monte Carlo tree search, with gold traces, then fine tune reasoning model


## ACL2025 Liu: Judge as a Judge: Improving the Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation {#acl2025-liu-judge-as-a-judge-improving-the-evaluation-of-retrieval-augmented-generation}

Key insight: is a panel of different LLMs to be synthesized together to improve retrieve augmented generation reward signal

Good baseline; also GLM-4


## ACL2025 Huang: low entropy watermark detection {#acl2025-huang-low-entropy-watermark-detection}

Key insight: current red green detection underestimate low entry positions because it can't be altered as much, fixed with Bayes rule
