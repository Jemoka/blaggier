general choice of sound

-   ominous/bad: low tonal drone
-   surveillance: loud high frequency buzz
-   final ending music contrasts with erythidng

---

-   uses immediate dialogue with no visuals to present focus
    -   rawness/truth of the dialogue (and arguably Snowden's good job at phrasing) makes it more compelling
    -   nat sound without visuals provide additional focus
-   background music modulates emotional valence

---

-   fairly significant use of nat packages to emphasize reality
-   the **tone** of the reading also modulates the opinion

---

-   the confrontation of the court creates tension
-   parallel contrasting statements

---

-   transition to Snowden interview feels relatively peaceful compared to the beginning, which is drawing attention in its own way
-   the jovial nature being in the room contrasts to the serious issue at hand
-   the cuts are really quite hard: to emphasize contrast between loud news breaks and the quietness of the hotel room---especially large contrast with regards to Ed Snowden's wife being raided, etc., which is rather peaceful
    -   or the quiet of TV television as compared to the loud noise of the nat package behind

---

-   the lack of speaking from the camera operator/sounds behind the makes the scene much more intimate
    -   i.e. this feels like a private conversation between a few people, despite there being what appears to be an entire camera crew with Laura (and she rarely speaks from behind the camera expect during the identity bits)
    -   the contrast of tensions is really interesting

-   TANGENT: Glen Greenwald seems to be pushing Snowden ("I'm not going to hide")

---

-   begin of the Monday clip with the time ticking highlights the intensity
-   the light from the reporter traking glen into the elevator (dark) cotrasts with the hotel (light)
    -   the microphone close to Snowden's chest amplifies heart rate

---

-   The rest of it feels really dull in a sharp contrast, as a fallout.
-   The British government feels more powerful, which is also why when TEMPORA is introduced the low humming ominous sounds are replaced with **loud pearcing sounds**

---

-   TANGENT: its really weird to be seeing people putting away phones but then there's a whole camera
-   the low droning voice returns promising government pressure, while the high buzzing noise returns when surveillance was covered
