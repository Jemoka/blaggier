Key question: **can multi-agent optimization problems help reinforcement learning stuff**


## using deep RL for combinatorial optimiazation {#using-deep-rl-for-combinatorial-optimiazation}

-   fast inference scals well with instance size
-   maybe difficult to actually discover optimal solution: high sample complexity, or failing to find good solutions
-   doesn't generalize well


## why multi-agent works {#why-multi-agent-works}

-   decentralized training to improve sample efficiency
-   adversarial training


## New Concepts {#new-concepts}
