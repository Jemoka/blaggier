-   analog: raw, continuous signal directly written down onto some kind of channel which accepts a range of values
    -   magnetic tape, with a range of magnetism to write down music
    -   film, which is directly sensitive to light
    -   phone, the sonic amplitude directly placed onto the phone wire
-   digital: storing whichever signal into bits; using only 0/1 bits to represent the entire signal


## Analog Communication {#analog-communication}

-   message to be communicated is one of a continuum of possibilities
-   can never fully remove the effect of noise which the communication channel gives


## Digital Communication {#digital-communication}

-   message to be communicated is one of a finite set of choices (0/1)
-   can remove the noise induced by the communication channel by rebinarizing ("on-off keying")---i.e. small fluctuations between voltages of transmission will not influence on/off measurement
