### conservatives in America make less sense because America is supposed to be liberal/new {#conservatives-in-america-make-less-sense-because-america-is-supposed-to-be-liberal-new}

For most Europeans who came to America, the whole purpose of their difficult and dis- ruptive journey to the New World was not to conserve European institutions but to leave them behind and to create something new, often an entirely new life


### Three splits of conservatism in America {#three-splits-of-conservatism-in-america}

1.  those who are most concerned about economic or fiscal issues, that is, pro-business or “free-enterprise” conservatives
2.  those most concerned with religious or social issues, that is, pro-church or “traditional-values” conservatives
3.  those most concerned with national-security or defense issues, that is, pro-military or “patriotic” conservatives


### Ronald Reagan unified the three conservatism {#ronald-reagan-unified-the-three-conservatism}

It was the achievement of Ronald Reagan that he was able in the late 1970s to unite these three different kinds of conservatism into one grand coalition.


### Three-in-one conservatism is a part of American "fusionist strategy" {#three-in-one-conservatism-is-a-part-of-american-fusionist-strategy}

This was the culmination of a “fusionist strategy” that had been developing amongst American conservatives since the early 1960s.


### Business and social conservatism should contradict each other, though {#business-and-social-conservatism-should-contradict-each-other-though}

However, as we shall see, pro-business conservatism has always included a tendency toward the disruption and even dissolution of religious ideals and social practices.


### Extreme pro-business should also include globalization and erasure of national identities {#extreme-pro-business-should-also-include-globalization-and-erasure-of-national-identities}

And in recent decades, pro-business conservatism has also included a tendency toward the dismantling of national boundaries and even dissolution of national identities


### "conservatism" actually conserved American revolutionary force economically {#conservatism-actually-conserved-american-revolutionary-force-economically}

this means that the conservative party in America has always sought to conserve a revolutionary force.


### Extreme economic "conservatism" should destry social and moral arrangements {#extreme-economic-conservatism-should-destry-social-and-moral-arrangements}

It destroys religious, social, and ultimately moral arrangements as well.


### Religions conservatism founds on the "open-market" of protestanism {#religions-conservatism-founds-on-the-open-market-of-protestanism}

This open market in religious matters, so nicely isomorphic with the open market in economic matters, was a powerful factor gen- erating both a reality and an ideology of free choice in the United States.


### Because the "new" became new protestanism, religious conservatism is the re-take over of traditional religions {#because-the-new-became-new-protestanism-religious-conservatism-is-the-re-take-over-of-traditional-religions}

Since these churches were continually being left behind, religious conservatism was associated with once-dominant churches that were now dwindling into a minority, and would later dwindle into marginality


### Because of mass economic benifit, religous conservatism became subordinated to economic conservatism {#because-of-mass-economic-benifit-religous-conservatism-became-subordinated-to-economic-conservatism}

Even ordinary middle-class Protestants benefited from cheaper labor, in the form of domestic servants. And of course it was the businessmen and middle-class Protestants who controlled the political parties, particularly that party which was supposed to be the more conservative one


### Because there is nothing to conserve about current system, the thing that's conserved is free choice {#because-there-is-nothing-to-conserve-about-current-system-the-thing-that-s-conserved-is-free-choice}

If something were going to be conserved, it would normally be the no-conscription and low-taxation (and free-choice) system.


### Economic systems propergated the source of American patriotism {#economic-systems-propergated-the-source-of-american-patriotism}

This meant that people who thought of themselves as American patriots or nationalists, and who sought to conserve the American nation and to promote American national interests


### American conservatism is actually a form of European liberalism {#american-conservatism-is-actually-a-form-of-european-liberalism}

we have seen that, from a European perspective, American conservatism was not conservative at all, but actually was a kind of classical lib- eralism.


### wartime strengthened American values and liberalism {#wartime-strengthened-american-values-and-liberalism}

Moreover, the wartime experience seemed decisively to vindicate and even enhance the strengths of both the traditional American economic system and traditional American moral principles.
