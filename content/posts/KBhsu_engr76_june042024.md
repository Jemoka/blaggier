Recall that we care about three things: \\(M, L, d\_{\min}\\). In a repetition code, as code-word size increases, our error probability decreases:

| L | p   |
|---|-----|
| 3 | p^2 |
| 5 | p^3 |

Recall [Shannon's Channel-Coding Theorem]({{< relref "KBhsu_engr76_may302024.md#shannon-s-channel-coding-theorem" >}}).
