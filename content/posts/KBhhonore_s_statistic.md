[Honoré's Statistic]({{< relref "KBhhonore_s_statistic.md" >}}) is a statistical measure of vocabulary complexity, it is a test of [Semantic Verbal Fluency]({{< relref "KBhsemantic_verbal_fluency.md" >}}) and is commonly used for cognitive impairment detection.

The statistic is defined as:

\begin{equation}
HS = 100 \log  \frac{N}{1-\frac{N\_{uni}}{U}}
\end{equation}

where, \\(N\\) is the total number of words, \\(U\\) the total number of distinct words, \\(N\_{uni}\\) the number of total distinct words used only once.

The idea here is that a higher diversity of vocabulary shows higher [Semantic Verbal Fluency]({{< relref "KBhsemantic_verbal_fluency.md" >}}).
