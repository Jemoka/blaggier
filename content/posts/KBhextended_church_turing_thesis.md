A Turing Machine can simulate every "reasonable" model of computation with only [Polynomial Time]({{< relref "KBhcomputational_complexity_theory.md#polynomial-time" >}}) increase in time complexity---possibly the "worse possible"

This is only a thesis! There's a chance, for instance, randomized quantum algorithms may change this.
