The [information theory]({{< relref "KBhinformation_theory.md" >}}) computational model behind [quantum theory]({{< relref "KBhquantum_theory.md" >}}). It proposes [quantum computer](#quantum-computer)s, proposed during the 80s. Theoretically, [quantum computer](#quantum-computer)s have [quantum supremacy](#quantum-supremacy), which is exciting. It is a theory that works with [counterfactual]({{< relref "KBhcounterfactual.md" >}}) information.


## quantum computer {#quantum-computer}

A [quantum computer](#quantum-computer) is a computer that uses [quantum effects]({{< relref "KBhquantum_theory.md" >}}) to perform Turing-like computations


## quantum supremacy {#quantum-supremacy}

That a [quantum computer](#quantum-computer) outperforms all classical computers


## universal computer {#universal-computer}

"a programmable system whose repertoire includes all physically possible computations" --- Turing.

You will realize that modern computers are not actually capable of all computations---apparently, they can't make itself.

Therefore, to actually achieve this, we have to make a more general type of computer: a [constructor]({{< relref "KBhconstructor_theory.md" >}}) --- a [universal quantum constructor.]({{< relref "KBhuniversal_quantum_constructor.md" >}})
