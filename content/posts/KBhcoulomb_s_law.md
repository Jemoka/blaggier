[coulomb's law]({{< relref "KBhcoulomb_s_law.md" >}}) is a principle that deals with the force that two charged particles exhibit to each other.


## constituents {#constituents}

-   \\(k\\), [Coulomb's Constant]({{< relref "KBhcoulomb_s_law.md" >}}), found roughly to be \\(9 \times 10^{9} \frac{N m^{2}}{C}\\)
-   \\(q\_{1,2}\\), the [charge]({{< relref "KBhcharged.md" >}}) of the two particles you are analyzing
-   \\(r\\), distance between particles


## requirements {#requirements}

\begin{equation}
\vec{F\_{E}} = k \frac{q\_1q\_2}{r^{2}}
\end{equation}


## additional information {#additional-information}


### interpreting signs on \\(F\_{e}\\) {#interpreting-signs-on-f-e}

-   negative: attraction force between changes (the points have opposite signed charges, and so attract)
-   positive: repulsion force between changes (the point have the same signed change, so repel)


### alternative formulation of Coulomb's Law {#alternative-formulation-of-coulomb-s-law}

The law is often [redefined with the language of the premittivity of free space]({{< relref "KBhpermittivity_of_free_space.md#redefinition-of-id-e9d5f9b8-f44f-4ec2-a3ca-eddf236efe1b-coulomb-s-constant-based-on-id-d9abe64a-7668-490b-a297-af51c8859624-permittivity-of-free-space" >}}):

\begin{equation}
\vec{F\_{E}} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon\_{0}} \frac{q\_1q\_2}{r^{2}}
\end{equation}


### superposition {#superposition}

The net [electric force]({{< relref "KBhcoulomb_s_law.md" >}}) on a test change is simply the sum of the [electric force]({{< relref "KBhcoulomb_s_law.md" >}})s which other particles exhibit on the test change. That is:

\begin{equation}
F\_{on\ 2} = F\_{1 \to 2} + F\_{3 \to 2}
\end{equation}
