[Monetarist theory]({{< relref "KBhmonetarist_theory.md" >}}) is a theory of economics proposed by [Milton Freedman]({{< relref "KBhmilton_freedman.md" >}}) which asserts that [Keynsian economics]({{< relref "KBhkeynsian_politics.md" >}}) only applies in the limited case that central bank need to keep the money supply growing; otherwise, the free market can handle itself.

Therefore the [Monetarist theorists]({{< relref "KBhmonetarist_theory.md" >}}) propose that the [stock market crash of 1929]({{< relref "KBhcauses_of_the_great_depression.md#stock-market-crash-of-1929" >}}) was caused that the US monetary fund did a bad job of actually controlling the funds, and didn't inject enough money into economy.
