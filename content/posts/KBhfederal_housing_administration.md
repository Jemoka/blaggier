A [New Deal]({{< relref "KBhnew_deal.md" >}}) program to help long-term families to have home. Tho program lowered down-payment for homes down from \\(50\\%\\) down to only \\(<10\\%\\). This is part of Roosevelt's New Deal to lower interest rates and increased national home ownership rates. This could have been attributed to programs to stabilize home prices. This specifically helped white families: favoured single-family homes.
