A discrete set of chances: die, coin flip, etc.

We use [probability mass function]({{< relref "KBhprobability_distributions.md#probability-mass-function" >}}) to model such a distribution:

\begin{equation}
\sum\_{i=1}^{n}P(X=i) = 1
\end{equation}

To each member of the distribution, we assign a [factor.]({{< relref "KBhfactor.md" >}}) The [parameter]({{< relref "KBhparameter.md" >}})s of this distribution are the probability values you assign to each group.
