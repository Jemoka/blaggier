On the dynamics of [Tuning Fork]({{< relref "KBhtuning_forks.md" >}})s. (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Rossing, Russell, and Brown 1992</a>)


## Characterizing Tuning Forks {#characterizing-tuning-forks}

Aluminum, tines 10mm apart. Four main groups of vibration:

1.  Symmetrical In-Plane
2.  Antisymmetrical In-Plane
3.  Symmetrical Out-Of-Plane
4.  Antisymmetrical Out-Of-Plane

(a) and (c) are in the first group; (b) is in the second group, where the fork just warps.


## Deriving Tuning Forks' Frequency {#deriving-tuning-forks-frequency}

As per before, we can treat tuning forks acting in clang and fundamental modes as a good'ol fashioned [cantilever beam]({{< relref "KBhcantilever_beam.md" >}}).

The frequency action of a [cantilever beam]({{< relref "KBhcantilever_beam.md" >}}) is defined as follows:

Otherwise, for asymmetric modes, we can use the same exact expression but with uniform rods unfixed at either end:

Note that density is not uniform at this point (because the bottom handle-y bit.)
