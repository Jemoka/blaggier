[thermoregulation]({{< relref "KBhthermoregulation.md" >}}) is the brain's regulation of body temperature to respond to heat, cold events.

Studies indicate that cold exposure cold exposure can activate [AgRP]({{< relref "KBhagrp.md" >}}) (stimulate food intake) as a means for the brain leveraging [CNS regulation]({{< relref "KBhcns_regulation.md" >}}) to which would lower the [glucose]({{< relref "KBhglucose.md" >}}) level and maintain [glucose homeostatis]({{< relref "KBhglucose_homeostatis.md" >}}).

However, cold exposure also trigger energy expenditure, and seems contradictory but _not really why?_.
