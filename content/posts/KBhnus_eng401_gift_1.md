The doctor-patient ratio in Haiti is 1 out of 67,000; a combination of malnutrition and malpractice results in a fatality rate of 47%.

In _Breath, Eyes, Memory_, the high rate of fatalities from birth is included as a part of a proverb in Sophie’s village. Ife tells that, of “three children” conceived by an old woman, “one dies in her body.” (Danticat 118)
