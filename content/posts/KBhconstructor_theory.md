[constructor theory]({{< relref "KBhconstructor_theory.md" >}}) deals with "[constructor]({{< relref "KBhconstructor_theory.md" >}})s", a general type of computer.

[constructor theory]({{< relref "KBhconstructor_theory.md" >}}) can give us a theory of the [universal quantum constructor]({{< relref "KBhuniversal_quantum_constructor.md" >}}) by expanding upon [quantum information theory]({{< relref "KBhquantum_information_theory.md" >}}). It allows us to unify quantum and classical information by simply defining operations in terms of [counterfactual]({{< relref "KBhcounterfactual.md" >}})s exclusively: that a space is entirely defined by what's possible and what's not possible.

According to [constructor]({{< relref "KBhconstructor_theory.md" >}}) theory, fundamental laws are not dynamical laws instead are boundary conditions. We can take the boundary conditions to form the most general set of initial conditions.

-   you can conjecture a set of laws is fully complete
-   at some point, you will find something that hits the bounds
-   then you revise the theory
