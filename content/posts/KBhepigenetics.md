[epigenetics]({{< relref "KBhepigenetics.md" >}}) is the ability to make identical cells present distinct phenotipic states.


## Why? {#why}

DNA is packaged by charged [histone]({{< relref "KBhhistone.md" >}}) proteins, and they wrap around the nucleosome. Upon acute changes in the environment, cells can change their epigenic states.


## whimsical adaptations {#whimsical-adaptations}

[Epigenetic]({{< relref "KBhepigenetics.md" >}}) adaptive states in organisms with no clear path adaptation. For instance, a certain lung cancer cell has this ability. So, how do cells decide what genes they would activate?

Another example: treating fisheries in caffine

-   Growing in caffine will trigger caffine resistance
-   Remove the caffine would cause some of them to default back, some of them to stay the same way
