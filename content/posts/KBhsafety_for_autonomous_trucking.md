challenges of autonomous driving

the world is messy---robo-taxies would be confused

It seems like an increasing trend to do data argumentation with generative approaches.


## safety standards {#safety-standards}


### ISO 26262 {#iso-26262}

how to do it , instead of what to do

-   functional safety standard
-   methods about testing and processes


### ISO 21448 {#iso-21448}

intended functionality

-   **scenario based** analysis of hazardous situations---"triggering conditions" =&gt; "mitigations" shown below
-   **identification and mitigation** of functional insufficiencies
-   (requires?) the discovering of unknown unknowns with mitigations


### Safety and AI {#safety-and-ai}

the actual safety challenges
