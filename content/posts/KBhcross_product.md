### lack of inverse of cross product {#lack-of-inverse-of-cross-product}

The [cross product]({{< relref "KBhcross_product.md" >}}) doesn't have an inverse


### geometric interpretation of [cross product]({{< relref "KBhcross_product.md" >}}) {#geometric-interpretation-of-cross-product--kbhcross-product-dot-md}

\begin{equation}
a \times b = |\vec{a}| |\vec{b}| \sin \theta n
\end{equation}

where, \\(n\\) is the unit vector in some direction.

The length of the resulting vector in the [cross product]({{< relref "KBhcross_product.md" >}}) is the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors.
