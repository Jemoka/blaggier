A [binary operation]({{< relref "KBhbinary_operation.md" >}}) means that you are taking two things in and you are getting one thing out; for instance:

\begin{equation}
f: (\mathbb{F},\mathbb{F}) \to \mathbb{F}
\end{equation}

This is also [closed]({{< relref "KBhclosed.md" >}}), but [binary operation]({{< relref "KBhbinary_operation.md" >}})s doesn't have to be.
