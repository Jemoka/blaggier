The [nsm]({{< relref "KBhnatural_semantic_metalanguage.md" >}}) theory is a theory that...

1.  claims that there exists a set of semantic primes and logic universal across languages which is indefinable by other words within the language
2.  which, as a corollary, resolves the epistemological problem that if all words are defined by other words in the language there will (why?) be no connection to the real world

the theory of [NSM]({{< relref "KBhnatural_semantic_metalanguage.md" >}}) rests on...


## two pillars of [NSM]({{< relref "KBhnatural_semantic_metalanguage.md" >}}) theory {#two-pillars-of-nsm--kbhnatural-semantic-metalanguage-dot-md--theory}


### existence of [semantic primes]({{< relref "KBhsemantic_primes.md" >}}) {#existence-of-semantic-primes--kbhsemantic-primes-dot-md}

The existence of [semantic prime]({{< relref "KBhsemantic_primes.md" >}})s is codified more formally as the strong version of the [Lexicalization Hypothesis]({{< relref "KBhlexicalization_hypothesis.md" >}}).

Issues with it: [problems with semantic primes]({{< relref "KBhsemantic_primes.md#problems-with-id-4e587814-bfd1-458e-ba5f-67882832107b-semantic-prime-s" >}})


### the ability to perform the act of [reductive paraphrase]({{< relref "KBhreductive_paraphrase.md" >}}) {#the-ability-to-perform-the-act-of-reductive-paraphrase--kbhreductive-paraphrase-dot-md}

## oh cool! {#oh-cool}

Also the fact that [NSM]({{< relref "KBhnatural_semantic_metalanguage.md" >}}) is first found in English means that there is a certain anglo-centrism that comes with the language.
