Speed up biosensor development? Preso felt like an ad.

[LucCage]({{< relref "KBhluccage.md" >}})

And then we throw ML at designing [LucCage]({{< relref "KBhluccage.md" >}}) binding structures. Using [LucCage]({{< relref "KBhluccage.md" >}}) florescence as a reporter tool for detection of the molecule

1.  we found [LucCage]({{< relref "KBhluccage.md" >}})
2.  used the platform + ML to engineer binding sites to things we want to bio on
3.  we tacked a light on it
4.  florescence
5.  now you have a lightbulb as an assay
