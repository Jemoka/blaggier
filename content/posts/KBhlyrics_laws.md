We go explore,
changing times,
parting ways.

Wanting no praise,
become greater
Than ever

We go explore,
shining lights
moving stars

Finding no target,
we cannot expect to see

How can we explore if we can't even feed?
Ourselves? Our families? Our digitaries?

How can we explore if we can't even seek.
Unatural exploration
Touching the depths with our feet

We go explore,
wondrous depths,
random seas

Wanting someone,
reminicing
the never

We go explore,
purple skies
acid rain

Finding the target,
we didn't know to see

How can we explore if we can't even feed?
Ourselves? Our families? Our digitaries?

How can we explore if we can't even seek.
Unatural exploration
Probing the depths with our feet
