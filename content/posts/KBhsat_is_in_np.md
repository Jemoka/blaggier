Recall [SAT]({{< relref "KBhnon_deterministic_turing_machines.md#boolean-formula-satisfiability" >}}) is in [NP]({{< relref "KBhnon_polynomial_time.md" >}}) because if \\(\phi \in \text{SAT}\\), then there is a short (poly-n space), efficiently (poly-time) checkable proof (by just reading out the satisfying assignment).
