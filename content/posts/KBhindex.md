Welcome to the personal site of ****Houjun "Jack" Liu****.

I'm on the blaggosphere as [u/jemoka](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jemoka/) and [@jemoka](https://github.com/Jemoka/).

## Who's this guy? {#who-s-this-guy}

I am a [human](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28765741?v=4) interested in [linguistic analysis](http://pubs.asha.org/doi/10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00642), [NLP](https://aclanthology.org/2024.crac-1.4.pdf), and [user interfaces](https://www.shabang.io). I think [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) &amp; [Emacs](https://github.com/Jemoka/.emacs.d) are cool. I run [Shabang](https://www.shabang.io), [do research in NLP and model-based RL]({{< relref "KBhresearch_index.md" >}}), and am working for [TalkBank](https://www.talkbank.org/) on the intersection between speech and language.

I'm currently doing my undergrad at Stanford, where I write some code for [Stanza](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza), a NLP package for many human languages, and a [rover that we are sending to Antarctica](https://github.com/stanford-ssi).

Need to catch me? Email me at `houjun@jemoka.com`. Please do email me, I actually check.


## Recent Projects {#recent-projects}

Take a look at my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Jemoka/) for programming projects. For larger scale things, you may be interested in learning about my [research projects](https://ai.stanford.edu/~houjun/) or [stuff I've built](https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhprojects/).


## Notes {#notes}

This site also contains the vast majority of my course notes. It is a organized in a [zettlekasten]({{< relref "KBhzettlekasten.md" >}}) format. To begin exploring, why don't you check out [Nueva Courses Index]({{< relref "KBhnueva_courses_index.md" >}}) and [Stanford UG Courses Index]({{< relref "KBhstanford_courses_index.md" >}}).


## jklsnt {#jklsnt}

Some friends and I started a small collection of fun internets that we made. [Check it out!](https://www.jklsnt.com/).


## How do I know you are you? {#how-do-i-know-you-are-you}

Good question! `gpg --locate-keys houjun@jemoka.com`. Note that GPG don't actually check fingerprints you received so do that yourself (`CA0D6B9C1EA1CD08F0AC1802E7EDDE691807A0C6`).
