The [Stable Matching Problem]({{< relref "KBhstable_matching_problem.md" >}}) is [Wes Chao]({{< relref "KBhwes_chao.md" >}})'s favourite algorithm.

Consider two populations, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), who want to form paired relationships between a person \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). \\(A\_i\\) has a list of their ranked order matches (I want to be paired with \\(B\_1\\) most, \\(B\_4\\) second, etc.), and so does \\(B\_i\\) (I want to be paired with \\(A\_4\\) most \\(A\_9\\) second, etc.)

We want to discover a [stable matching]({{< relref "KBhstable_matching.md" >}}), where pairs are most unwilling to move. We can solve it using the [stable matching algorithm]({{< relref "KBhstable_matching_algorithm.md" >}}).

## applications of the [stable matching problem]({{< relref "KBhstable_matching_problem.md" >}}) {#applications-of-the-stable-matching-problem--kbhstable-matching-problem-dot-md}

-   Dating
-   Applying to college
-   Both of these are high-stress situations, especially if you are doing asking
-   You can mathematically prove that _person doing the asking gets the best result_

Hence, it shows us that the ****best possible outcomes go to the people who are willing to ask and get rejected.****


## extensions to the stable matching problem {#extensions-to-the-stable-matching-problem}

the [stable matching problem]({{< relref "KBhstable_matching_problem.md" >}}) can be extended to the [rural hospitals problem]({{< relref "KBhrural_hospitals_problem.md" >}}), which is slightly better.
