The [curse of dimensionality]({{< relref "KBhcurse_of_dimensionality.md" >}}) is the result of correlatives of the fact that:

at higher dimensions, **most random data points become equidistant from each other** --- you can prove this to yourself [pythagoras]({{< relref "KBhcornucopia_of_analysis.md#pythagorean-theorem" >}}) and some math of [expectation]({{< relref "KBhexpectation.md" >}})

1.  random vectors are almost orthogonal
2.  unit sphere takes almost no volume in unit square (?)
