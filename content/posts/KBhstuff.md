My friends call me Jack, and you can too!

If you are looking for a formal homepage, you may find my [website](https://www.jemoka.com/) or [academic site](https://ai.stanford.edu/~houjun) more useful to you in that pursuit. Instead, I will instead keep this page updated with some [stuff]({{< relref "KBhstuff.md" >}}) (hence the title). Everybody and their cat seem to have a convictions page, so I figured I do the same here.

-   You can just do things, remember that [Stardew was made by one guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/75ag0g/im_concernedape_creator_of_stardew_valley_ask_me/)
-   Being optimistic and upbeat has the following surprising properties
    -   Its infectious
    -   Its self-propagating
-   "always the stairs, never the escalator"
-   Your most high value action is to be a cheerleader and steelman of your friends
    -   this frequently means that contextualized harsh feedback is often the best thing you can tell someone
-   Relentlessly question assumptions, and understand things from first principles
-   Guard your time fiercely, partition it consciously, otherwise it'll disappear on you
-   It's really fun to be fast!

Having now spewn forth very Bay-Area classic takes, I now have some Bay Area revisionism for you: I think the Bay has its own very groupthink mentality which is conducive to high velocity, but perhaps have lost some of the high-impact (read: "hippy") stuff it did in the 80s and 90s. And so...

-   Fun fact: you need 2 bowls of ricenoodles a day to survive; a sudden glut of 10 bowls will just result in wasted ricenoodles
    -   ...and so work to win the long race, not just to have fun now
-   The trend to be "tech native" [enshittifies your shit](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/googles-new-logos-are-bad/), [knock it off](https://x.com/usgraphics/status/1946611727967412296). You know what's an enduring brand for the last 100 years, and will for the next 100? a nice [bottle of Coke](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Coca-Cola_logo.svg/2560px-Coca-Cola_logo.svg.png).
-   No, its not cool to sleep at the office. We stay because we have to and the work is important (perhaps [the most important we can do as a species](https://agi.safe.ai/)), not because we want to.

Work to maximize living good life, and sadly, a pre-scarcity world means you have to actually try. So let's fucking ball üèÄ


## Friends? {#friends}

Contrary to popular belief I actually spend a decent amount of time going outside and having friends. You should meet them, they are very cool.

-   [Sanity](https://www.jklsnt.com/) ([David](https://www.quantumi.sh/), [Hux](https://www.huxley.sh/), [Alb](https://exr0n.com/), and [Zach](https://github.com/zbuster05)) is a friend group formed over COVID that I still consider my best friends
-   I feel very lucky to have met many legendary friends during my time at Stanford, including [Joseph](https://shetaye.me/), [Mason](https://www.kc3wny.com/), [Danny](https://kdrag0n.dev/) and [John](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-corso-3591b0293/); some are so legendary they won't let me list them here, you know who you are
-   I'm privileged to have enjoyed a long and productive friendship with two close collaborators, [Amelia](https://ameliahardy.github.io/) and [Robert](https://robertcsordas.github.io/), and similarly I'm very grateful to friends and colleges at [SISL](https://sisl.stanford.edu/) and [Stanford NLP](https://nlp.stanford.edu/)


## Picture? {#picture}

If you want photographic evidence of my face, [here you go](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28765741?v=4). I also spend a decent amount of time these days [frolicking in the outdoors]({{< relref "KBhfrolicing_in_the_outdoors.md" >}}), which tends to generate pictoors which you can view [here]({{< relref "KBhfrolicing_in_the_outdoors.md" >}}).
