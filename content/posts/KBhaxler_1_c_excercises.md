3: Show that the set of differential real-valued functions \\(f\\) on the interval \\((-4,4)\\) such that \\(f'(-1)=3f(2)\\) is a subspace of \\(\mathbb{R}^{(-4,4)}\\)

---

4: Suppose \\(b \in R\\). Show that the set of continuous real-valued functions \\(f\\) on the interval \\([0,1]\\) such that \\(\int\_{0}^{1}f=b\\) is a subspace of \\(\mathbb{R}^{[0,1]}\\) IFF \\(b=0\\)

Additive Identity:

assume \\(\int\_{0}^{1}f=b\\) is a subspace
