[identities]({{< relref "KBhidentity.md" >}}) allows another [number]({{< relref "KBhnumber.md" >}}) to retain its identity after an [operation]({{< relref "KBhoperation.md" >}}).

What [identities]({{< relref "KBhidentity.md" >}}) are applicable is [group]({{< relref "KBhgroup.md" >}}) dependent. [Identities]({{< relref "KBhidentity.md" >}}) are almost always [object]({{< relref "KBhobjects.md" >}}) dependent.
