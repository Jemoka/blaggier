[natural number]({{< relref "KBhnatural_numbers.md" >}})s (\\(\mathbb{N}\\)) are the counting numbers: 1,2,3,4....

Zero is not part of it; this produces interesting results like set of [natural number]({{< relref "KBhnatural_numbers.md" >}}) under [addition]({{< relref "KBhadding.md" >}}) is not a [group]({{< relref "KBhgroup.md" >}}) because there is no [identity]({{< relref "KBhidentity.md" >}}) (tbh nor [inverse]({{< relref "KBhinverses.md" >}}) (inverse of 1 is -1 which is not in the set.))
