## artificial vs biological intelligence {#artificial-vs-biological-intelligence}

-   Humans are few-shot learners ("sample efficiency")
-   Humans can easily fine-tunable ("transfer flexibility")
-   Human knowledge can transfer easily

-   AI are many-shot learners ("sample inefficiency")
-   AI are specialized
-   AI is more precise, and can hold a lot in cache


## biological learning {#biological-learning}

[biological learning](#biological-learning) is mostly unsupervised, and yte can generalize
