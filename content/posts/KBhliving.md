Something is considered "[Living]({{< relref "KBhliving.md" >}})" when they exhibit two main biological functions


## Two Main Functions of Life {#two-main-functions-of-life}

-   [metabolism]({{< relref "KBhmetabolism.md" >}}): "do chemistry to change internal consistence"
-   [replication]({{< relref "KBhreplication.md" >}}): "copying cell information"


## theories of origin of life {#theories-of-origin-of-life}

-   Manfred Eigen ("[RNA-World](#theories-of-origin-of-life)" theory): genes form, constructing enzymes, forming cells
-   Alexander Oparin: cells form, creating enzymes as needed, forming the genes to encode them
-   Freeman Dyson: [Dyson's Model of Life]({{< relref "KBhdyson_s_model_of_life.md" >}})---basically the Oparin model, but with more specifics about how genes evolve
