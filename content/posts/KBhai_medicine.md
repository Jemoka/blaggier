**AI/Clinical Decision Support**

-   workload measurement
-   clinical wellness, etc.
-   perioperative outcomes

Big problem: integration is impossible; there's lots of models. "Researched models are **rarely** implemented; implemented models are **rarely** researched". Epic doesn't stand behind its models.

Implementation of AI based mechanisms though "saves time" on paper, results in more patient throughput and patient burn. At this point: harder question---not whether you can make a model, but how do you govren their use and actually put them into implementation.
