SnowMed CT: large medical ontology

1.  created pairwise distance matrix on SnowMed CT
2.  created weighted graphs using the SnowMed information
3.  Node2Vec! Suddenly you have an embedding for each disease.

Two Tasks:


## Patient Disease Embeddings {#patient-disease-embeddings}

Using the node2vec with snowmed


## Similar Patient Retrial {#similar-patient-retrial}

Reveal hidden co-morbidities via [Jaccard Coefficient]({{< relref "KBhranked_information_retrieval.md#jaccard-coefficient" >}})
