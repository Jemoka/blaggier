We will take \\(G(P(t),t)\\) to figure the price of an option, with \\(t\\) being time, strike price \\(X\\) (not introduced yet), and expiration date \\(T > t\\) on a stock with price \\(P(t)\\) at time \\(t\\).

This representation does something really important: it expresses \\(G\\) as a function of only the _current_ stock price \\(P(t)\\).
