A [morphism]({{< relref "KBhmorphism.md" >}}) is a not-necessarily-invertible map between two [object]({{< relref "KBhobjects.md" >}})s of a [category]({{< relref "KBhcategory.md" >}}). If the map is indeed [invertable]({{< relref "KBhinvertability.md" >}}), then we call the map an [isomorphism]({{< relref "KBhisomorphism.md" >}}).
