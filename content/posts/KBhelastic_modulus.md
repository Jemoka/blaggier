The [Elastic Modulus]({{< relref "KBhelastic_modulus.md" >}}) is a measurement of how much deformation takes place given some force on the system. Formally, it is the slope of the [stress]({{< relref "KBhstress.md" >}})-[strain]({{< relref "KBhstrain.md" >}}) curve, defined by:

\begin{equation}
E = \frac{stress}{strain}
\end{equation}

The units in pascals as it is: force per area (pascals) divided by deformation (dimensionless, as it is a fraction of old shape over new shape \\(\frac{V}{V}=1\\)).

Depending on how its measured, it is called different things:

-   [Young's Modulus]({{< relref "KBhyoung_s_modulus.md" >}}): tensile elasticity---tendency for object to deform along an axis with force applied (usually that _is_ just called the [Elastic Modulus]({{< relref "KBhelastic_modulus.md" >}}))
-   Shear's Modulus: shear elasticity---tendency of an object to shear (deform in shape with the constant volume) with force applied
-   Bulk Modulus: volumetric elasticity---tendency for an object to deform in all directions when uniformly loaded
