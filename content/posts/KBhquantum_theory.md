[quantum theory]({{< relref "KBhquantum_theory.md" >}}) allows us to understand [physics]({{< relref "KBhphysics.md" >}}); it reconciliations the classical world with the quantum world.

1.  Classical particles, in the [double slit experiment]({{< relref "KBhdouble_slit_experiment.md" >}}), would just straight go through and bounce off
2.  Actual particles (quantum) like light, under [quantum theory]({{< relref "KBhquantum_theory.md" >}}), would actually exhibit interference via wave-like hebahior

The measurement of [quantum theory]({{< relref "KBhquantum_theory.md" >}}) is done via [quantum information theory]({{< relref "KBhquantum_information_theory.md" >}}).
