Using a bunch of signals to create a 3d representation of the system

## studying large-scale viron behavior {#studying-large-scale-viron-behavior}

Misc. Discoveries bydoing a bunch of MD

-   proteins of specific virons "breath": oning and closing an entire backbone group; this is not yet quantified in physical modeling
-   when its open, the "breathing open" motion causes the virus to be vunerable
-   \*we don't \*
-   "we are so biased by what we can see experimentally"
