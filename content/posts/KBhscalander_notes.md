-   adding emails need sequential typing
-   hitting enter should move on to the next page
-   date selection
-   "Monday next week" doesn't NLP
-   reading calendar output isn't sorted


## bugs {#bugs}

-   reading other people's calendars isn't working
-   need some information about that the heck is actually happening on the scheduling
-   show other people's overall availibliity in the scheduling page
-   idea of "budget"


## next actions {#next-actions}

-   ****scheduling multiple people is broken. ah.****
-   ****have the idea of a "meeting owner", and we only reach out to them to confirm final date + have an ability to add a message (with templates); also allow the message owner to change to alternate schedules on that date (have default notifications in the iCal invite)****
    -   somehow remind people after the fact that the meeting is scheduled
    -   tie in evite abilities (this will be nice for your party, etc.)
        -   event planning built in? type in a budget and find vendors for the party.
        -   age range?
-   ****the weight number doesn't make sense---correct alt-text and make the number work****


## home page {#home-page}

-   "the front page looks like that for an OB-GYN" --- feels like ZocDoc
-   it is also not that fun
-   maybe some kind of memphis design
