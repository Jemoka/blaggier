---

1.  Harms: what are the problems in the status quo?

2.  Inherency: what are these problems not already being solved? (Or not already being solved in the best way?)

3.  Significancy: comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the status quo and your proposed solution, why is the proposed solution more worthy than the status quo?

The Ws:

1.  Why this? Why is your proposed solution the best (most effective, or most feasible, or fastest, etc.) one?

2.  Why now? Why is now the best time to build this solution?

3.  Why you? Why are you (and your team) the best builders of this solution?
