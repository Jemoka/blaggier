The [Lexicalization Hypothesis]({{< relref "KBhlexicalization_hypothesis.md" >}}) is a hypothesis proposed by [Chomsky]({{< relref "KBhchomsky.md" >}}) that states that syntactic transformations can only apply on [syntatic constituents]({{< relref "KBhsyntatic_constituents.md" >}}); therefore, the rules of putting words together is _different_ from the rules that puts phrases together. This theory stands in opposition to [generative semantics]({{< relref "KBhgenerative_semantics.md" >}}).

There are two versions of the [Lexicalization Hypothesis]({{< relref "KBhlexicalization_hypothesis.md" >}}):


## Strong [Lexicalization Hypothesis]({{< relref "KBhlexicalization_hypothesis.md" >}}) {#strong-lexicalization-hypothesis--kbhlexicalization-hypothesis-dot-md}

The [Strong Lexicalization Hypothesis](#strong-lexicalization-hypothesis--kbhlexicalization-hypothesis-dot-md) states that _both_ [derivational words]({{< relref "KBhderivational_words.md" >}}) (changes meaning, bench=&gt;benching) or [inflectional words]({{< relref "KBhinflectional_words.md" >}}) (changes grammar, eat=&gt;eating) cannot be put together via syntatical rules.

## Weak [Lexicalization Hypothesis]({{< relref "KBhlexicalization_hypothesis.md" >}}) {#weak-lexicalization-hypothesis--kbhlexicalization-hypothesis-dot-md}

[Weak Lexicalization Hypothesis](#weak-lexicalization-hypothesis--kbhlexicalization-hypothesis-dot-md) states that semantic rules cannot work in the formation of [derivational words]({{< relref "KBhderivational_words.md" >}}) only.
