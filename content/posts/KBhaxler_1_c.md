## Key Sequence {#key-sequence}

-   we defined [subspace]({{< relref "KBhsubspace.md" >}}) and how to check for them
-   we want to operate on subsets, so we defined the [sum of subsets]({{< relref "KBhsum_of_subsets.md" >}})
-   we saw that the [sum of subspaces]({{< relref "KBhsum_of_subsets.md" >}}) are the [smallest containing subspace]({{< relref "KBhsum_of_subsets.md#sum-of-subspaces-is-the-smallest-subspace-with-both-subspaces" >}})
-   and finally, we defined [direct sum]({{< relref "KBhdirect_sum.md" >}})s and how to prove them


## New Definitions {#new-definitions}

-   [subspace]({{< relref "KBhsubspace.md" >}})
-   [sum of subsets]({{< relref "KBhsum_of_subsets.md" >}})
-   [direct sum]({{< relref "KBhdirect_sum.md" >}})


## Results and Their Proofs {#results-and-their-proofs}

-   checking for subspaces
    -   [simplified check for subspace]({{< relref "KBhsubspace.md#simplified-check-for-subspace" >}})
    -   [sum of subspaces is the smallest subspace with both subspaces]({{< relref "KBhsum_of_subsets.md#sum-of-subspaces-is-the-smallest-subspace-with-both-subspaces" >}})
-   creating direct sums
    -   [a sum of subsets is a direct sum IFF there is only one way to write \\(0\\)]({{< relref "KBhdirect_sum.md#a-id-1b800658-2f83-4802-acfd-2d15cf5a1d74-sum-of-subsets-is-a-id-4e586014-c91f-4d52-98bb-a2fe11a75007-direct-sum-id-fddf0648-91ea-4c5b-8298-fa0a30637cb7-iff-there-is-only-one-way-to-write-0" >}})
    -   [a sum of subsets is only a direct sum IFF their intersection is the set containing \\(0\\)]({{< relref "KBhdirect_sum.md#a-id-1b800658-2f83-4802-acfd-2d15cf5a1d74-sum-of-subsets-is-only-a-id-4e586014-c91f-4d52-98bb-a2fe11a75007-direct-sum-id-fddf0648-91ea-4c5b-8298-fa0a30637cb7-iff-their-intersection-is-set-containing-0" >}})


## Questions for Jana {#questions-for-jana}

-   ~~Does the [additive identity]({{< relref "KBhadditive_identity.md" >}}) have be the same between different [subspace]({{< relref "KBhsubspace.md" >}})s of the same [vector space]({{< relref "KBhvector_space.md" >}})?~~ yes, otherwise the larger [vector space]({{< relref "KBhvector_space.md" >}}) has two [additive identities]({{< relref "KBhadditive_identity.md" >}}).
-   ~~Does the [addition]({{< relref "KBhadding.md" >}}) and [multiplication]({{< relref "KBhmultiplying.md" >}}) operations in a [subspace]({{< relref "KBhsubspace.md" >}}) have to be the same as its constituent [vector space]({{< relref "KBhvector_space.md" >}})?~~ by definition
-   ~~Why are [direct sum]({{< relref "KBhdirect_sum.md" >}})s defined on sub-****spaces**** and not [sum of subsets]({{< relref "KBhsum_of_subsets.md" >}})?~~ because the union is usually not a [subspace]({{< relref "KBhsubspace.md" >}}) so we use sums and keep it in subspaces
