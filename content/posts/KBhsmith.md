[HSVI]({{< relref "KBhhsvi.md" >}})


## One-Liner {#one-liner}

"impact of approximation decreases as steps from the root node"


## Novelty {#novelty}

-   combined alpha-vector and forward heuristics to guide search of belief states before backup
-   100x times faster in [PBVI]({{< relref "KBhpoint_based_value_iteration.md" >}})
-   scales to _huge_ environments

Goal: minimize "regret" (difference until optimal policy)


## Novelty HSVI 2 {#novelty-hsvi-2}

-   Projected the upper bound onto a convex hull (HSVI2: via approximate convex hull projection)
-   uses [blind lower bound]({{< relref "KBhblind_lower_bound.md" >}})
