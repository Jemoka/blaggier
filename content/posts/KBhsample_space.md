[sample space]({{< relref "KBhsample_space.md" >}}) \\(S\\) is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. It could be continuous or distinct.


## equally likely outcomes {#equally-likely-outcomes}

Some [sample space]({{< relref "KBhsample_space.md" >}})s have equally likely outcomes:

-   coin flip
-   flipping two coins
-   rolling a fair die

If we have [equally likely outcomes](#equally-likely-outcomes), \\(P(outcome)\\)  = \\(\frac{1}{S}\\).

If your sample space has [equally likely outcomes](#equally-likely-outcomes), the probability is juts counting:

\begin{equation}
P(E) = \frac{count(E)}{count(S)}
\end{equation}

Whenever you use this tool, you have to think about whether or not your outcomes are **equally likely**. For instance, the "sum of two dice rolling" is **NOT** equally likely.

Distinct [counting]({{< relref "KBhcounting.md" >}}) makes things equally likely.
