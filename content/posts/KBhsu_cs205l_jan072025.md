## noise vs. features {#noise-vs-dot-features}

If you know a property of the underlying distribution, noise and the important underlying feature could look very similar (think a sinusoid vs. just Gaussian noise).


## learning {#learning}

[learning](#learning) is the practice of training a system to do something....


### knowledge based system {#knowledge-based-system}

A John McCarthy-esque learning system using knowledge: 1) knowledge base, with explicit facts with experts and 2) an inference engine, a way to reason and generate new facts.

This approach is **discrete** and has **no inherent error**


### machine learning {#machine-learning}
