Iteration of Healthcare System

digital structure =&gt; configuration =&gt; activities or processes =&gt; outcomes =&gt; more structures

-   EHR
-   decision support systems

Technology in general is becoming safer over time =&gt; ideally, some form of high level safety is achieved.

important: **define a shared vocabulary between technologists and clinicians**


## Technology-Induced Errors {#technology-induced-errors}

Though EHS can serve to **reduce medical errors**, it can work in **increase errors** as well.

-   bias
-   ignorance of environmental factors
-   Error reporting + incident reporting


## Resolution {#resolution}

-   get rid of each problem
-   help establish well-configured systems which could promote safety
-   patient simulation with clinician + technology to see how it fits into process of care
-   what could that look like from a home health-care perspective
