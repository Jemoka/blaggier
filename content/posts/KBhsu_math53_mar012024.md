We've gone over [Heat Equation]({{< relref "KBhheat_equation.md" >}}), [Wave Equation]({{< relref "KBhwave_equation.md" >}}), and let's talk about some more stuff.

-   [damped heat equation]({{< relref "KBhdamped_heat_equation.md#damped-heat-equation" >}})
-   [damped wave equation]({{< relref "KBhdamped_wave_equation.md#damped-wave-equation" >}})
-   [two-dimensional heat equation]({{< relref "KBhtwo_dimensional_heat_equation.md" >}})
