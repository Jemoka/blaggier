ineffability of language vs. Sapire-Wolf

Foreignizing Time in Heptopod B

Louise's ability to re-express her temporally-independent thoughts in English after learning Heptopod B represents a successful act _foreignization_ of Heptopod thought for an English L1 audience despite this audience's supposed limitations in understanding temporally-independent concepts according to the Sapir-Wholf Hypothesis.


## Heptopod B does not have temporality {#heptopod-b-does-not-have-temporality}

-   RUSSIAN SCIENTIST: "Their final words translate to, "There is no time, many become one." I fear we have all been given weapons because we answered the timeline wrong, please, if you - -"
-   "Explain it by saying that light minimized the time needed to travel to its destination, and one saw the world as the heptapods saw it."

So it seems like quintessential Sapir-Wholf: time hard to express with Heptopod, and so their way of thinking work around it.

-   "Sapir’s point was that instead of saying that Latin and Greek are well suited to abstract thought, we should say, rather, that abstract thought is well suited to Greek and Latin and view the particular kinds of philosophical discourse that were developed by their speakers as a consequence of the grammar they used"

and there are evidence for it... Louis got this ability and then can think into the future.

-   "It worked better when I didn't think about it too much. ... my initial strokes almost always turned out to be compatible with an elegant rendition of what I was trying to say.  I was developing a faculty like that of the heptapods."


## Louise ditches temporality in her ENGLISH as well {#louise-ditches-temporality-in-her-english-as-well}

And yet, Louis very effectively translated HB into English by abusing English grammar.

-   "you will be twenty-five then"
-   LOUISE "We are so bound by time; by its order."
-   LOUISE: "I forgot how good it feels to be held by you"

-   So this lack of temporality not ineffable: "translation is the enemy of the ineffable. One causes the other to cease to exist."
-   nobody knows how to translate “animal signals” into human speech or vice versa. When and if we ever can translate nonhuman noises into human speech, species-related ineffabilities will evaporate like the morning haze.

So despite English grammar's temporality, it can be adapted.

This process of translation can be explained effectively in English, even if the original event is not:

-   DR. KETTLER "Not everyone is wired for what you're about to do. Our brains aren't always able to process experiences like this."


## Moving though over to another language is actually essentially just forenizing {#moving-though-over-to-another-language-is-actually-essentially-just-forenizing}

So: non-temporality vis a vi Heptopod B can be expressed in any language that you desire, except for the fact that it will be forenizing and hence require understanding of their _culture_. It is **not** that L1 itself limits understanding of L2 culture vis a vi S-W; instead, L2 culture needed to be understood correctly to foreignize for L1 audience. Louis does this.

-   louis is forenizing
    -   "As a result, the “foreign-soundingness” of a translation seeking to give the reader a glimpse of the authentic quality of the source can only reproduce and reinforce what the receiving culture already imagines the foreign to be. ... Foreign-soundingness is therefore only a real option for a translator when working from a language with which the receiving language and its culture have an established relationship"
    -   Louise establishes this relationship
        -   LOUISE: "Language is the foundation of civilization. "It is the glue that holds a people together, and it is the first weapon drawn in a conflict."
        -   "The only way to learn an unknown language is to interact with a native speaker, and by that I mean asking questions, holding a conversation ... without that, it's simply not possible."

We get to hear it too: film VFX forenization; "in the pitch of the low tone reverberating inside. ... another metallic ROAR. Followed by a distant HIGH PITCH." the **music** is forenizing

## Stuff from Chaing {#stuff-from-chaing}

-   "you will be twenty-five then"
-   "Over time, the sentences I wrote grew shapelier, more cohesive. I had reached the point where it worked better when I didn't think about it too much. Instead of carefully trying to design a sentence before writing, I could simply begin putting down strokes immediately; my initial strokes almost always turned out to be compatible with an elegant rendition of what I was trying to say. I was developing a faculty like that of the heptapods."
-   "I could understand that: the physical attributes that humans found intuitive, like kinetic energy or acceleration, were all properties of an objectat a given moment in time."
-   "And these were conducive to a teleological interpretation of events: by viewing events over a period of time, one recognized that there was a requirement that had to be satisfied, a goal of minimizing or maximizing. And one had to know the initial and final states to meet that goal; one needed knowledge of the effects before the causes could be initiated. I was growing to understand that, too."
-   "Gary once told me that the fundamental laws of physics were time-symmetric, that there was no physical difference between past and future."
-   "Explain it by saying that light minimized the time needed to travel to its destination, and one saw the world as the heptapods saw it."


## Stuff from Bellows {#stuff-from-bellows}

-   "A reader who says that poetry is what has been lost in translation is also claiming to be simultaneously in full possession of the original (which is poetry) and of the translation (which is not). Otherwise there would be no knowing if anything has been lost, let alone knowing that it was poetry."
-   "Because if the inhabitants of the distant planet did have a language, and if the space crew had learned it, then it must be possible for them to say what the aliens had said. Must, not should: radically untranslatable sounds do not make a language simply because we could not know it was a language unless we could translate it, even if only roughly"
-   "The tonal and rhythmic patterns of whale song are of such complexity as to make it quite impossible to believe that what we can hear (and pick up on instruments more sensitive than human ears) is just random noise."
-   nobody knows how to translate “animal signals” into human speech or vice versa. When and if we ever can translate nonhuman noises into human speech, species-related ineffabilities will evaporate like the morning haze.
-   Translation is the enemy of the ineffable. One causes the other to cease to exist.
-   Foreign-soundingness is therefore only a real option for a translator when working from a language with which the receiving language and its culture have an established relationship.
-   But there are significant differences between cultures and languages in how people do things with words.
-   "Different languages, [Wilhelm] von Humboldt saw, were different worlds, and the great diversity of natural languages on the planet should be seen as a treasure house of tools for thinking in other ways."
    -   Wilhelm von Humboldt, elder brother of the great explorer Alexander
-   "The evidence itself brought [Sapir] to see that any attempt to match the grammar of a language with the culture of its speakers or their ethnic origins was completely impossible. “Language,” “culture,” and “race” were independent variables."
-   "Sapir’s point was that instead of saying that Latin and Greek are well suited to abstract thought, we should say, rather, that abstract thought is well suited to Greek and Latin and view the particular kinds of philosophical discourse that were developed by their speakers as a consequence of the grammar they used"
-   "It means that speakers of what Sapir called “Average West European” are poorly equipped to engage in Hopi thought. To expand our minds and to become more fully civilized members of the human race, we should learn as many different languages as we can."
