the [inverse]({{< relref "KBhinverses.md" >}}) is the the opposite of an [operation]({{< relref "KBhoperation.md" >}}). As in, if you apply the [inverse]({{< relref "KBhinverses.md" >}}) of an [operation]({{< relref "KBhoperation.md" >}}) to the result of applying the original with the same [operation]({{< relref "KBhoperation.md" >}}) it will cancel it.

That is,

\begin{equation}
    A \* B \* B^{-1} = A
\end{equation}

\\(B^{-1}\\) is then the [inverse]({{< relref "KBhinverses.md" >}}) of \\(B\\) for the \\(\*\\) operation. This is [operation]({{< relref "KBhoperation.md" >}}) dependent.
