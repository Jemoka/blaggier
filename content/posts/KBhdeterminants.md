For a [matrix]({{< relref "KBhmatricies.md" >}}), for instance, like:

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\\\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

We wish to find the matrix's determinant; we write it down as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{vmatrix}
a & b \\\\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}
\end{equation}


## geometric interpretation of determinants {#geometric-interpretation-of-determinants}

Geometrically, determinants are how matrices send a unit object after its mapping; i.e. how does it transform the area of a unit square.


## determinants can be computed along any axes {#determinants-can-be-computed-along-any-axes}

You can pick any row or column as the "axes", and expand the matrix along any direction
