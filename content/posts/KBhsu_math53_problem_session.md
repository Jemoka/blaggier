## L-Periodic Functions {#l-periodic-functions}

So, we have:

\begin{equation}
f(x+L) = f(x)
\end{equation}

The integral is equivalent for any:

\begin{equation}
\int\_{a}^{a+L} f(x)
\end{equation}

for any \\(a\\).


## Heat Equation Recipe {#heat-equation-recipe}

1.  are we on a finite interval? then, decompose into product-type solution \\(A(t)B(x)\\) and solve.
2.  are we not? Fourier transform on the space variable and solve.


### What if \\(\lambda \in \mathbb{C} \backslash \mathbb{R}\\) {#what-if-lambda-in-mathbb-c-backslash-mathbb-r}

Shush.


### Why can we guess \\(A(t)B(x)\\) {#why-can-we-guess-a--t--b--x}

Because we were able to find solutions. Believe that the solution set spans.


## Fourier Transform on Three-Variable Expressions {#fourier-transform-on-three-variable-expressions}

We have better Fourier transforms on n-space rather than on a line. Use those.


## Existence and Uniqueness + Superposition {#existence-and-uniqueness-plus-superposition}
