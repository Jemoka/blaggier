A friend recently asked for recommendations for shoes and jackets, and I realized that the links on my [gear]({{< relref "KBhgear.md" >}}) page has slowly died (very sad). So I figured I should update it with more information and alternatives.


## What I (normatively) do {#what-i--normatively--do}

I'll give specific recommendations shortly, but before I do that I feel like it'd be helpful to give some normative statements about what "good" gear to me feels like.


### light, and waterproof, in that order {#light-and-waterproof-in-that-order}

I try to get things that are both waterproof and light, and if both doesn't exist (in particular for shoes), I prioritize being light.

This can be justified somewhat as a high measure (<https://web.archive.org/web/20230207121856/https://taimur.me/posts/measure-a-mental-model-for-decision-making/>) decision, in the sense of:

1.  I have to carry around the gear a lot (i.e., they have to be high availability)
2.  I can't afford (temporally, financially, mentally) multiple copies for different scenarios
3.  Back pain

so I try to spend a semi-stupid amount on gear that fits the exact load-bearing requirements to make my life easier.


### minimized style/logos {#minimized-style-logos}

I think icons/branding is bad and makes me feel like a walking advertisement. In particular this is why I refuse categorically to wear Adidas clothing because of the stupid stripes. I try to buy cloths that minimal in style (i.e., MUJI).


### get it (in spirit) from REI {#get-it--in-spirit--from-rei}

Like for carabiners, so with cloths. If it works to save hikers' life, it surely works for some urban scrambling. Try to get things that are battle-tested or at least variants of them.

This, of course, assumes that you do what I do which is buy this once and use it for as long as you don't loose it, up to replacing and resurfacing. Fashion and/or daily travel doesn't work this way.

Often you will realize that performance requirements change dramatically if you are actually using them to do things. A pair of normal khakis are $50ish, the same technical pants for EMS are upwards of $80. Not a huge difference, but it does make one.


### a note about cost {#a-note-about-cost}

gear I end up choosing are largely super duper expensive (your tax dollars at work!); I buy very little other things, so it mostly works out, but it doesn't mean your actual cost is actually this high. For instance, for jackets (in particular not! shoes; break in shoes by yourself), second hand + retreating the Gore-Tex fabric often does wonders.


## What I do {#what-i-do}

Let's begin with what I actually wear; mostly these are no longer on sale except for the second-hard market.


### Jacket {#jacket}

In terms of rain jackets you can't really get better than the ultralight jackets from Arcteryx.

-   I loved the Norvan SL, but at the time it was more out of range: <https://www.rei.com/product/117215/arcteryx-norvan-sl-hoodie-mens>
-   or, its sibling, Norvan LT, which was more in range: <https://geartrade.com/products/arcteryx-norvan-lt-hoody-mens-1067816> (used link for $200!)

Arcteryx apparently still sells this line of Jackets, just at a stupid high price of $450: <https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/mens/norvan-jacket-9571>. I can't vouch for how good they are physically, but from product photos they look much stupider than the original versions if nothing else but the enormous logo.


### Shoes {#shoes}

I wear three types of shoes, two for daily carry, both from Merrill, and one for support, being Asics.

-   **summer**: for non-rainy-seasons, and in terms of general carry, there's nothing in my opinion that beats the Embark Lace sneaker: <https://www.merrell.com/US/en/embark-lace-sneaker/52565M.html?dwvar_52565M_color=J067217> (for some reason, only this hilarious aqua colour is available, but for $50 bucks!)
-   **winter**: sadly you can only buy these used, but for trail hiking/weather withstanding, the Gore-Tex MQM-3 from Merrill is light and unbeatable: <https://www.ebay.com/itm/126614314821> (they don't see it anymore :/)
-   **running\*/\*tennis**: asics Gel-Kayano: <https://www.asics.com/us/en-us/gel-kayano/c/aa50101000/> (much like wands, everybody and they running shoes is a 1 to 1 match, I wouldn't overindex on this)


## What I recommend {#what-i-recommend}

I have no clue why I'm qualified to give product recommendation, but here goes. Also here's a [fun ultralight packing list](https://www.thepackablelife.com/hiking/gear/ultralight-backpacking-gear) which is cool.


### Jacket {#jacket}

-   $300-400 range: [M10 from Patagonia](https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-m10-storm-waterproof-alpine-jacket/85910.html#) (10 oz), or [Arc'teryx's stupid looking new Norvans](https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/mens/norvan-jacket-9571) (7.6 oz)
-   sub-$200 range: Montbell Versalite Jacket (6.4 oz!, this is on sale somewhere, but for some reason you can't buy it in the US?)
-   sub-$100 range: [REI Rainier Rain Jacket](https://www.rei.com/product/227570/rei-co-op-rainier-rain-jacket-mens) (11.3 oz)
-   sub-$30, a garbage bag to put over you: [Frog Toggs Ultra-Lite2](https://www.froggtoggs.com/products/the-frogg-toggsr-ultra-lite2tm-4749)


### Shoes {#shoes}

I feel unqualified as to give shoe opinions because they can't be measured as easily. Also I find that decent shoes are always in the $50 - $150 price range, unless something is up or you run marathons.


#### Summer {#summer}

Other than the admittedly garish colour, I think one can't beat the [Embark Lace](https://www.merrell.com/US/en/embark-lace-sneaker/52565M.html?dwvar_52565M_color=J067217&icid=search_suggested_products). Its slip on, breathable, very light (7.19 oz) **non-water-proof**. Overall pretty happy.


#### Winter {#winter}

I still wear my [MQM-3](https://www.merrell.com/UK/en_GB/mqm-3-gore-tex/52476M.html) (11.63 oz) daily, and if you can find it, you shod too; I heard [Agility Peak Gore Tex](https://www.merrell.com/US/en/agility-peak-5-gore-tex/58253M.html) running shoes are pretty good, but it really isn't a shoe for more technical scrambling, etc.


#### Running {#running}

You can still buy a Gel-Kayano. But your mileage may vary and you should visit a Footlocker.
