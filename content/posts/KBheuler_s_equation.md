\begin{equation}
f(x) = e^{ix} = \cos (x) + i\sin (x)
\end{equation}

this brings a circle of radius one, because in every point, velocity is orthogonal to where you are (because \\(f'(x) = if(x)\\), and multiplying by \\(i\\) accounts for a rotation of 90 degrees.

And so,

\begin{equation}
z = re^{i\theta}
\end{equation}

gives any point in the imaginary polar plane.
