an [First Order ODE]({{< relref "KBhfirst_order_odes.md" >}}) is "autonomous" when:

\begin{equation}
y' = f(y)
\end{equation}

for some \\(f\\) of one variables. Meaning, it only depends on the independent variable \\(t\\) through the use of \\(y(t)\\) in context.

This is a special class of [seperable diffequ]({{< relref "KBhseperable_diffequ.md" >}}).


## autonomous ODEs level off at stationary curves {#autonomous-odes-level-off-at-stationary-curves}

for autonomous ODEs can never level off at non-stationary points. Otherwise, that would be a stationary point.

See [stability (ODEs)]({{< relref "KBhstability.md" >}})


## time-invariant expressions {#time-invariant-expressions}

For forms by which:

\begin{equation}
y' = f(y)
\end{equation}

as in, the expression is **time invariant**.
