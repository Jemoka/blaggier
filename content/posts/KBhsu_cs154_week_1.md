## computing {#computing}

[computing](#computing) is to find out something by using **mathematical processes** ...which doesn't necessarily require computers

[computing](#computing) is the evolution of an environment via repeated applications of simple, local rules


### computational lens {#computational-lens}

"is it likely / could this computation (i.e. folding proteins) be done within the timeframe given?"

these computations emerge sometimes naturally; such as markets computing equilibrium simply by buying and selling directly.


### zero-knowledge {#zero-knowledge}

[zero-knowledge](#zero-knowledge) proofs are proofs which is able to show results in computation without being given the knowledge that's needed as inputs to the proof. this is usually true due to [limited resources](#zero-knowledge) in computation


## graph coloring {#graph-coloring}

can we legally 3-color (such that any adjacent nodes are colored differently) some particular graph? **a central question of computer science**: because if you can, then P=NP; otherwise P!=NP.


### 4-coloring theorem {#4-coloring-theorem}

any graph can be colored with a legal 4-coloring
