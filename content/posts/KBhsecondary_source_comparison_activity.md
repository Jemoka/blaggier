### That, if an action were to be done as in a community, its regarded as safer {#that-if-an-action-were-to-be-done-as-in-a-community-its-regarded-as-safer}

It is a very personal grief and a personal statement done among people you trust. Done within the context of the community, therefore safe.


### Public (white-washed) and private image, by necessesity, is separated {#public--white-washed--and-private-image-by-necessesity-is-separated}

My single solitary and individual Jifejs like the lives of the tribe; it differs in these specific ways, but it is a balanced life because it is both solitary and representative

### That the story of the novel is told where the reader constructs the story together {#that-the-story-of-the-novel-is-told-where-the-reader-constructs-the-story-together}

To construct the dialogue so that it is heard. So that there are no adverbs attached to them: "loudly," "softly," "he said menacingly.'


### That the artistry is not described as Black but inherently black {#that-the-artistry-is-not-described-as-black-but-inherently-black}
