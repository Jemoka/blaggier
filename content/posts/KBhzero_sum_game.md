A [Zero-Sum Game]({{< relref "KBhzero_sum_game.md" >}}) happens during the following situation:

We have two distributions \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). A "[Zero-Sum Game]({{< relref "KBhzero_sum_game.md" >}})" is a case where:

\begin{equation}
P(success) = P(Y > X)
\end{equation}

(because \\(Y>X \implies X< Y\\), so there's no case whereby a situation can both "cause success").
