Reflection
What I found most peculiarly interesting is the focus on many mathematical/physics texts on the idea of the &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; of the expressions; and, it seems, the clear pleasure that Wigner gets from analyzing the systems with the aforementioned &ldquo;beauty.&rdquo;
Setting aside whether or not this beauty is &ldquo;deserved&rdquo;/appropriate, I love that my attraction to physics is somewhat similar to what Wigner describes. Under the appropriate conditions, with constraints, it is possible to build a solution to physics problems simply through the evolution of mathematics."><meta name=author content="Houjun Liu"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/all.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/page.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/syntax.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/typography.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/components.css></head><body><div class="center-clearfix p-10" style="max-width:1200px;margin:0 auto"><header class=pb-4><span class="w-full flex justify-between flex-wrap"><div style=font-weight:600;font-size:15px><a style=border:0;cursor:pointer href=/><img src=/images/Logo_Transparent.png style=width:17px;display:inline-block;margin-right:8px;transform:translateY(-2.7px)></a>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences</div><span style="float:right;display:flex;align-items:center;margin-top:5px;width:100%;max-width:400px;background:#fff;border-radius:2px;border:1px solid var(--gray-2);position:relative"><i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass" style=font-size:12px;color:var(--yellow-fg);margin-right:7px;margin-left:10px></i><div style=width:100%><input id=search-query-inline name=s type=text autocomplete=off placeholder="Search Knowledgebase" enterkeyhint=search></div><div id=search-result-inline style=display:none></div><script id=search-result-template type=text/x-js-template data-template=searchresult>

I like that Winger ended on the note about how &ldquo;false&rdquo; theories, even despite their falseness, provided shockingly accurate estimations of physical phenomena. Perhaps mathematics provides an almost-fully solid foundation to creating physical systems, but then the entire &ldquo;flaw&rdquo; we see with mathematical modeling is in our (in)ability to provide the limitations to scope.</p><p>For instance, Bohr&rsquo;s model, an example of &ldquo;falsehood&rdquo; modeled, is an over-limitation to scope which&mdash;thought reducing mathematical complexity&mdash;resulted in a &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; theory. However, the mathematics behind the theory remains to be solid despite the scope limitation, making the result work in a reasonable manner (except for the pitfalls).</p><p>The inherent concern behind this statement, then, is that there is a case where we can build a perfectly reasonable system to model something, but it turns out that the system is correct only in the limited scope which we are used to operating; when suddenly the scope becomes broken, we are so used to the mathematical tools that we have came to rely on that we don&rsquo;t notice their failures.</p><p>I like that this entire point is brought up before our start in DiffEq, perhaps as a &ldquo;with great power comes great responsibility&rdquo; type of caution to us in terms of how our modeling may go awry while at the same time acting as a preview of the usefulness of the principles provided taken as a whole.</p><h2 id=reading-notes>Reading notes</h2><h3 id=maths-show-up-at-entirely-random-places>Maths show up at entirely random places</h3><p>The first point is that mathematical concepts turn up in entirely unexpected connections.
