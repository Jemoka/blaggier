polarization distorts beliefs about others
“Recent years have seen a sharp increase in political polarization in the United States (1–7), leading to deadlock in Congress (8), distorted beliefs about fellow Americans (9, 10), and distrust, hostility, and even violence toward outgroup members (11–13)” [Novoa et al., 2023, p. 1]
generics about particular group is a way that polarized languages manifest
“Specifically, we focus on expressions that make claims about a category as a whole (e.g., “Democrats want to defund the police” makes a claim about the category of “Democrats”), also known as generics (34–38).” [Novoa et al., 2023, p. 2]"><meta name=author content="Houjun Liu"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/all.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/page.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/syntax.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/typography.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/components.css></head><body><div class="center-clearfix p-10" style="max-width:1200px;margin:0 auto"><header class=pb-4><span class="w-full flex justify-between flex-wrap"><div style=font-weight:600;font-size:15px><a style=border:0;cursor:pointer href=/><img src=/images/Logo_Transparent.png style=width:17px;display:inline-block;margin-right:8px;transform:translateY(-2.7px)></a>PWR1 Texts in Conversation Planning</div><span style="float:right;display:flex;align-items:center;margin-top:5px;width:100%;max-width:400px;background:#fff;border-radius:2px;border:1px solid var(--gray-2);position:relative"><i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass" style=font-size:12px;color:var(--yellow-fg);margin-right:7px;margin-left:10px></i><div style=width:100%><input id=search-query-inline name=s type=text autocomplete=off placeholder="Search Knowledgebase" enterkeyhint=search></div><div id=search-result-inline style=display:none></div><script id=search-result-template type=text/x-js-template data-template=searchresult>
