In recent years, political polarization has increased in many democratic societies. As Diamond has observed, &ldquo;among the liberal democracies, partisan and ideological polarization is often worrisomely high, while political tolerance and trust have eroded.&rdquo; This trend also manifests itself in the growing ideological distance between political parties, increasing partisanship among the electorate, and the erosion of civility in public discourse."><meta name=author content="Houjun Liu"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/all.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/page.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/syntax.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/typography.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/components.css></head><body><div class="center-clearfix p-10" style="max-width:1200px;margin:0 auto"><header class=pb-4><span class="w-full flex justify-between flex-wrap"><div style=font-weight:600;font-size:15px><a style=border:0;cursor:pointer href=/><img src=/images/Logo_Transparent.png style=width:17px;display:inline-block;margin-right:8px;transform:translateY(-2.7px)></a>SU-COLLEGE110 Second Essay Planning</div><span style="float:right;display:flex;align-items:center;margin-top:5px;width:100%;max-width:400px;background:#fff;border-radius:2px;border:1px solid var(--gray-2);position:relative"><i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass" style=font-size:12px;color:var(--yellow-fg);margin-right:7px;margin-left:10px></i><div style=width:100%><input id=search-query-inline name=s type=text autocomplete=off placeholder="Search Knowledgebase" enterkeyhint=search></div><div id=search-result-inline style=display:none></div><script id=search-result-template type=text/x-js-template data-template=searchresult>
