We used the family to push economic growth, factoring the ambitions of a person and his family into our planning. We have tried, for example, to improve the lot of children through education.” ([⁨Zakaria⁩ and ⁨Yew⁩, 1994, p. 114])</p><h4 id=claims-family-as-a-unit-for-survival>claims family as a unit for survival</h4><p>And through all that turbulence, the family, the extended family, the clan, has provided a kind of survival raft for the individual” ([⁨Zakaria⁩ and ⁨Yew⁩, 1994, p. 115])</p><h4 id=family-as-a-means-of-increasing-survival-over-time>family as a means of increasing survival over time</h4><p>But the family and the way human relationships are structured, do increase the survival chances of its members. That has been tested over thousands of years in many different situations.” ([⁨Zakaria⁩ and ⁨Yew⁩, 1994, p. 115])</p><h4 id=rejects-equal-representation-by-using-family-values-as-a-proxy-for-long-term-thinking>rejects equal representation by using family values as a proxy for long-term thinking</h4><p>But I&rsquo;m convinced, personally, that we would have a better system if we gave every man over the age of 40 who has a family two votes because he&rsquo;s likely to be more careful, voting also for his children. He is more likely to vote in a serious way than a capricious young man under 30. But we haven&rsquo;t found it necessary yet.” ([⁨Zakaria⁩ and ⁨Yew⁩, 1994, p. 119])</p><h4 id=equates-having-diversity-with-separateness-wc-of-sensitive>equates having diversity with separateness, wc of &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo;</h4><p>You cannot have too many distinct components and be one nation. It makes interchangeability difficult. If you want complete separateness then you should not come to live in the host country. But there are circumstances where it is wise to leave things be. For instance, all races in Singapore are eligible for jobs and for many other things. But we put the Muslims in a slightly different category because they are extremely sensitive about their customs, especially diet.” ([⁨Zakaria⁩ and ⁨Yew⁩, 1994, p. 120])</p><h4 id=america-takes-action-on-a-nation-level-whereas-singapore-acts-on-the-individual-level>America takes action on a nation level whereas Singapore acts on the individual level</h4><p>&ldquo;When [America] is provoked it captures the president of Panama and brings him to trial in Florida. Singapore does not have that option. We cant go to Burma and capture warlords there. What we can do is to pass a law which says that any customs officer or policeman who sees anybody in Singapore behaving suspiciously, leading him to suspect the person is under the influence of drugs, can require that man to have his urine tested.&rdquo; ([⁨Zakaria⁩ and ⁨Yew⁩, 1994, p. 120])</p><h4 id=characterizes-american-individualism-as-dogmatic-yet-not-universal>characterizes American individualism as dogmatic yet not universal</h4><p>But the idea of the inviolability of the individual has been turned into dogma. And yet nobody minds when the army goes and captures the president of another state and brings him to Florida and puts him in jail. I find that incomprehensible.” ([⁨Zakaria⁩ and ⁨Yew⁩, 1994, p. 112])</p><h4 id=describes-hierarchy-and-structure-as-also-an-element-of-western-thought>describes hierarchy and structure as also an element of Western thought</h4><p>Hierarchy, deference and elitism are ideas well rooted in the tradition of Western conservative thought, and they derive their relevance for Bell’s work from debates internal to the history of Western political thought. So why travel to the East to discover them?” ([Nathan, p. 76])</p><h4 id=some-metric-states-that-the-us-is-a-non-pure-democratic-republic>some metric states that the US is a non-pure-democratic Republic</h4><p>From this premise, according to a not uncommon belief among Americans, it follows that the United States is not a democracy but a republic..” ([Dahl, 2001, p. 5])</p><h4 id=us-electoral-college-is-not-proportional-representation--i-dot-e-dot-non-pure-democracy>US electoral college is not proportional representation (i.e. non pure democracy)</h4><p>Yet the electoral college still preserved features that openly violated basic democratic principles: citizens of different states would be unequally represented, and a candidate with the largest number of popular votes might lose the presidency because of a failure to win a majority in the electoral college.” ([Dahl, 2001, p. 31])</p><h4 id=us-politics-competition-is-a-distraction>US politics&rsquo; competition is a distraction</h4><p>The people lack any real opportunity to think in depth about what they really want done.

Japans powerful gov ernment constantly intrudes into the business world to protect perceived national interests, to the point of causing disputes with the United States and other trading partner (Kim Dae Jung)</p><h4 id=structure-as-a-means-to-freedom>structure as a means to freedom</h4><p>In the East the main object is to have a well-ordered society so that everybody can have maximum enjoyment of his freedoms. This freedom can only exist in an ordered state and not in a nat ural state of contention and anarchy.</p><h4 id=lack-of-liberty-is-a-threat-to-democracy>lack of liberty is a threat to democracy</h4><p>“Liberties of thought and discussion are necessary for any widespread application of what we will call deliberative democracy by the people themselves.” [Fishkin, 2018, p. 6]</p><h4 id=hairscarf>hairscarf</h4><p>“if she joined the customs or immigration department where it would be confusing to the millions of people who stream through to have some customs officer looking different, she must wear the unifor” (<a href=zotero://select/library/items/CRPLRJEI>⁨Zakaria⁩ and ⁨Yew⁩, 1994, p. 121</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D2I7MJAM?page=14&amp;annotation=7ZKPVETK">pdf</a>)</p><h3 id=sub-claim-development>Sub-Claim Development</h3><h4 id=conflation-of-the-enforcement-of-structure-against-the-lack-of-individual-rights-is-how-eastern-societies-can-be-seen-as-undemocratic>conflation of the enforcement of structure against the lack of individual rights is how eastern societies can be seen as undemocratic</h4><p><a href=#definitions-of-success-is-metric-sensitive>definitions of success is metric sensitive</a>, and <a href=#bell-characterizes-performance-by-harmony>Bell characterizes performance by harmony&mdash;structure</a>.
