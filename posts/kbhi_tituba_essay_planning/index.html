Prompt
In an interview, Maryse Conde explains, &ldquo;I was attracted to write the particular story of Tituba because this woman was unjustly treated by history. I felt the need to give her a reality that was denied to her because of her color and her gender.&rdquo; Choose one or two literary devices and explain how Conde uses it/them in the novel to give Tituba her subjecthood.

Life would only be a gift if each of us could choose the womb that carried us. &mldr; If one day I am born again, let it be in the steely army of conquerors! (120)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Tituba believes that she is born as a healer</p><p>The terror of these people seemed like an injustice to me. They should have greeted me with shouts of joy and welcome and presented me with a list of illnesses that I would have tried my utmost to cure. I was born to heal, not to frighten. (12)</p></li></ul><h4 id=births-other-people>&ldquo;Births&rdquo; Other People</h4><ul><li><p>Elizabeth Parris &ldquo;reborn&rdquo; after Tituba&rsquo;s Care</p><p>Up till then I had not called on the supernatural to care for Elizabeth Parris. &mldr; hat night I decided to use my powers. &mldr; In the morning the color returned to Goodwife Parris&rsquo;s cheeks. She asked for a little water. Toward midday she managed to feed herself. And in the evening she went to sleep like a newborn babe. (45)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The &ldquo;evil&rdquo; of abortion transferred from Tituba into Betsy</p><p>I made her swear not to tell anyone and at dusk I plunged her up to her neck in a liquid to which I had given all the properties of amniotic fluid. &mldr; Plunging Betsey into this scalding hot bath, it seemed to me that these same hands, that not long ago had dealt death were now giving life, and I was purifying myself of the murder of my child. (63)</p><p>Her upper lip curled up into an ugly pout, revealing her sick gums. &ldquo;You, do good? You&rsquo;re a Negress, Tituba! You can only do evil. You are evil itself.&rdquo; &mldr; &ldquo;That bath you had me take; what was in it? The blood of a newborn baby that died from one of your spells?&rdquo; I was aghast.

You know how much slaves are selling for at the present time? Twenty-five pounds!&rdquo; Our conversation stopped there, but now I knew the fate awaiting me. Another master, another bondage. (120)</p><p>Then with one skillful blow of the mallet he smashed my chains to pieces. He did the same thing with my wrists while I screamed. &mldr; I screamed, and this scream, the terrified cry of a newborn baby, heralded my return to this world. I had to learn how to walk again. &mldr; Few people have the misfortune to be born twice. (122)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Tituba&rsquo;s &ldquo;real&rdquo; story begins only after death</p><p>And that is the story of my life. Such a bitter, bitter story. My real story starts where this one leaves off and it has no end. (175)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Successful rebirth only without birth</p><p>I watched her grow up and stumble around on her shaky legs, exploring the pur- gatory of the plantation, finding her delight in the shape of a cloud, the drooping foliage of an ylang-ylang, or the taste of a bitter orange. &mldr; A child I didn&rsquo;t give birth to but whom I chose! What motherhood could be nobler! (177)</p></li></ul><h4 id=misc>Misc</h4><ul><li><p>Book opens with the framing of her being born</p><p>I was born from this act of aggression.

It is little more than the expulsion of an innocent baby, who will have no chance to change its fate, into a world of slavery and abjection&mldr;. That night, my baby was carried out of my womb in a flow of black blood. I saw him wave his arms like a tadpole in distress and I burst into tears.

Both of them turned on her.

Despite Tituba&rsquo;s own failed attempt at controlling the (re)birth of herself and others to better their fate in history, Condé offers Tituba a renewed empowerment in birth by both illustrating her &ldquo;rebirth&rdquo; and providing her a chance to elect a descendant she wasn&rsquo;t originally able to bear.</p></div></article></main><footer style=margin-top:20px><p id=footer style=font-size:8px;color:var(--gray-3)>&copy; 2019-2025 Houjun Liu.
