ineffability of language vs. Sapire-Wolf
Foreignizing Time in Heptopod B
Louise&rsquo;s ability to re-express her temporally-independent thoughts in English after learning Heptopod B represents a successful act foreignization of Heptopod thought for an English L1 audience despite this audience&rsquo;s supposed limitations in understanding temporally-independent concepts according to the Sapir-Wholf Hypothesis.
Heptopod B does not have temporality

RUSSIAN SCIENTIST: &ldquo;Their final words translate to, &ldquo;There is no time, many become one.&rdquo; I fear we have all been given weapons because we answered the timeline wrong, please, if you - -&rdquo;
&ldquo;Explain it by saying that light minimized the time needed to travel to its destination, and one saw the world as the heptapods saw it.&rdquo;

So it seems like quintessential Sapir-Wholf: time hard to express with Heptopod, and so their way of thinking work around it."><meta name=author content="Houjun Liu"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/all.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/page.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/syntax.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/typography.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/components.css></head><body><div class="center-clearfix p-10" style="max-width:1200px;margin:0 auto"><header class=pb-4><span class="w-full flex justify-between flex-wrap"><div style=font-weight:600;font-size:15px><a style=border:0;cursor:pointer href=/><img src=/images/Logo_Transparent.png style=width:17px;display:inline-block;margin-right:8px;transform:translateY(-2.7px)></a>Arrival Movie</div><span style="float:right;display:flex;align-items:center;margin-top:5px;width:100%;max-width:400px;background:#fff;border-radius:2px;border:1px solid var(--gray-2);position:relative"><i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass" style=font-size:12px;color:var(--yellow-fg);margin-right:7px;margin-left:10px></i><div style=width:100%><input id=search-query-inline name=s type=text autocomplete=off placeholder="Search Knowledgebase" enterkeyhint=search></div><div id=search-result-inline style=display:none></div><script id=search-result-template type=text/x-js-template data-template=searchresult>
