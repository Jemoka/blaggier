<meta name=description content="Reading notes
conservatives in America make less sense because America is supposed to be liberal/new
For most Europeans who came to America, the whole purpose of their difficult and dis- ruptive journey to the New World was not to conserve European institutions but to leave them behind and to create something new, often an entirely new life
Three splits of conservatism in America

those who are most concerned about economic or fiscal issues, that is, pro-business or “free-enterprise” conservatives
those most concerned with religious or social issues, that is, pro-church or “traditional-values” conservatives
those most concerned with national-security or defense issues, that is, pro-military or “patriotic” conservatives

Ronald Reagan unified the three conservatism
It was the achievement of Ronald Reagan that he was able in the late 1970s to unite these three different kinds of conservatism into one grand coalition."><meta name=author content="Houjun Liu"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/all.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/page.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/syntax.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/typography.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/components.css></head><body><div class="center-clearfix p-10" style="max-width:1200px;margin:0 auto"><header class=pb-4><span class="w-full flex justify-between flex-wrap"><div style=font-weight:600;font-size:15px><a style=border:0;cursor:pointer href=/><img src=/images/Logo_Transparent.png style=width:17px;display:inline-block;margin-right:8px;transform:translateY(-2.7px)></a>Origins of American Conservatism</div><span style="float:right;display:flex;align-items:center;margin-top:5px;width:100%;max-width:400px;background:#fff;border-radius:2px;border:1px solid var(--gray-2);position:relative"><i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass" style=font-size:12px;color:var(--yellow-fg);margin-right:7px;margin-left:10px></i><div style=width:100%><input id=search-query-inline name=s type=text autocomplete=off placeholder="Search Knowledgebase" enterkeyhint=search></div><div id=search-result-inline style=display:none></div><script id=search-result-template type=text/x-js-template data-template=searchresult>
